ERA18LA096
Date & Time:
March 6, 2018, 10:05 Local 
Registration:
N6764W
Aircraft:
Piper PA 28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and a student pilot were practicing pattern work at the airport. Due to their injuries, 
they did not recall any events before the accident. A witness reported that during a landing just before 
the accident, the airplane was "low" on the final leg of the traffic pattern, appeared to have increased 
engine power to clear the tree line, and then continued on the approach. The witness did not observe the 
accident sequence. Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that the airplane struck trees 
before impacting the ground about 750 ft before the runway. Examination of the airplane revealed no 
evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal engine 
operation. Given the available information, it is likely that the flight instructor allowed the airplane to 
descend below a normal approach path to the runway, as seen on a previous approach, which resulted in 
the collision with trees and terrain.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to maintain the appropriate glidepath to the runway, which resulted in a 
collision with trees and terrain during final approach.
