Location:
Warrenton, Virginia
Accident Number:
GAA16CA477
Date & Time:
September 9, 2016, 12:15 Local 
Registration:
N750SS
Aircraft:
PACIFIC AEROSPACE CORP LTD 
750XL
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
14 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Skydiving
Analysis 
The pilot reported that this was his third skydiving flight of the day and he performed a back taxi on the 
runway for takeoff. He further reported that as he rotated the airplane for takeoff, he heard a "steady" 
stall warning horn, the flight controls felt mushy, and the airplane would not climb. The pilot reported 
that he aborted the takeoff and applied max braking and reverse thrust, but the airplane overran the 
runway remaining. Subsequently, the landing gear collapsed and the airplane collided with a fence.  
The left and right wing sustained substantial damage.  
After the accident, the pilot reported that he observed the wing flaps in the fully retracted position. He 
reported that the flaps should have been set to 20 degrees for takeoff. The pilot reported that he forgot to 
set the flaps during the back taxi for takeoff because he was communicating with other airplanes near 
the airport. The pilot reported that he did not use a physical checklist, but he did run through a checklist 
mentally.    
The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to set the wing flaps for takeoff, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall, an 
aborted takeoff, and a runway overrun.
