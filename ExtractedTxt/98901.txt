Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot in the amphibious float-equipped airplane reported that he intended to perform a water landing. 
On the downwind leg of the approach, he performed his prelanding checks from memory, and he 
confirmed that the three green landing gear safe lights were illuminated. However, he added that he 
"should have looked for blue lights." The pilot landed on the water with the landing gear wheels 
extended, and the airplane pitched forward and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to 
the right wing, the empennage, and the windscreen. The pilot asserted that he "should have used a 
checklist once airborne. Both the after takeoff and before landing checks would have saved me from this 
event." The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to retract the amphibious float's landing gear wheels before landing on the water. 
Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to use the after takeoff and before landing checklists.
