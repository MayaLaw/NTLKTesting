Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was flying a recently purchased airplane. During initial climb, the front right 
cockpit door opened. He decided that the condition was unsafe and entered a left downwind to land. The 
approach end of the runway had rising terrain, and the airplane was too high and fast. About 200 ft 
above ground level, he decided to abort the landing, but the engine sputtered, and he continued the 
landing. The airplane overran the runway and collided with a fence. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and the elevator.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain the proper airspeed during landing, which resulted in the airplane landing 
too fast and too far down the runway to safely stop it.
