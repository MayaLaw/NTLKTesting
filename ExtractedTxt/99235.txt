Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Harlingen, Texas
Accident Number:
CEN19FA117
Date & Time:
April 9, 2019, 10:33 Local 
Registration:
N7314D
Aircraft:
Air Tractor AT 502
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Low altitude operation/event
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting an agricultural flight when witnesses observed the airplane flying at a 
low altitude before it collided with power transmission lines and terrain. The airplane was 
destroyed during a postimpact fire. Examination of the airplane wreckage did not reveal any 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Toxicology testing detected the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine in the pilot’s blood. 
Considering that postmortem redistribution of diphenhydramine may result in central levels 
being two-to-three times higher than peripheral levels, the circulating level was likely in the 
therapeutic range at the time of the accident. Given the pilot’s years of experience and 
familiarity with the agricultural airplane, it is reasonable to consider diminished reaction times 
and flying performance attributable to the use of sedating medication likely contributed to the 
accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to maintain clearance from power transmission lines during low altitude 
flight operations. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s impairment due to a sedating 
medication.
