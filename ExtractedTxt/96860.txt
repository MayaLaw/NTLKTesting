Analysis 
The pilot reported that during the landing roll he felt as though the airplane was being pushed to the left 
side of the runway so he applied full right rudder and left aileron. The airplane exited the left side of the 
runway, and he added power to prevent the airplane's nose from colliding with a drainage culvert, but 
the airplane accelerated and impacted a tree. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the leading edge of the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot reported that the wind at the destination airport was from 90Â° at 10 knots, gusting to 15 knots. 
The airplane landed on runway 24.
The pilot landed to runway 24 because of the 2.9-percent uphill gradient.
