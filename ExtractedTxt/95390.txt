Analysis 
The pilot reported that the takeoff, climb, and en route portions of the cross-country flight were 
uneventful. He checked the wind sock before landing, and it was "flaccid," indicating calm wind. He 
slowed the airplane to 80 mph on final approach and landed near the approach end of the runway, which 
was 2,355 ft long. He estimated that the airplane should have rolled to a stop; however, it continued 
down the runway despite heavy braking. The airplane departed the end of the runway, traveled across a 
small road and down an embankment, and came to rest in water at the edge of the airport boundary.
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector examined the wreckage and reported that the airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage and submersion in salt water. There were tire skid 
marks on the runway leading to the wreckage. A weather buoy, located about 1 mile east of the airport, 
recorded wind from the west about the time of the accident, which would have resulted in a tailwind of 
up to 8 knots. The pilot reported there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to stop the airplane within the available runway after conducting the approach and 
landing with a tailwind.
