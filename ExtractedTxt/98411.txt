Analysis 
The pilot reported that she initiated the landing flare and that the airplane floated about 100 ft and landed 
normally. About 400 ft into the landing roll, the airplane veered right, exited the right side of the 
runway, and collided with taxiway lights before coming to rest. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage intermediate bulkhead.
The pilot reported that, during landing, the windsock indicated "no wind." However, after the accident, 
she and her passenger saw dust devils close to the runway.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
The airport's METAR reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was variable at 6 knots. The 
pilot landed the airplane on runway 30.
