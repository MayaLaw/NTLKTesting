Registration:
N14842
Aircraft:
ROSE PARRAKEET A-1
Aircraft Damage:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot had just departed from the airport when witnesses observed the airplane not climbing 
and about 100 ft above the ground. Another witness observed the airplane a nose-high attitude. The 
airplane was struggling to gain altitude before it banked "hard" to the right, entered a "sharp" nose-down 
attitude, and impacted a field near the airport.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded 
normal operation. The ground scarring at the accident site, the crush angle of the airframe, and the 
observed wing drop before the airplane's descent into terrain were consistent with an exceedance of the 
airplane's critical angle of attack and a resulting aerodynamic stall.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack after takeoff, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Angle of attack - Capability exceeded
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot
