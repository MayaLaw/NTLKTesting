Analysis 
While maneuvering during a local instructional flight, the engine began running rough, and the 
instructor decided to return to the airport. The engine subsequently lost total power and the propeller 
stopped rotating. The instructor performed a forced landing to a clearing where the airplane nosed over, 
resulting in substantial damage. 
Examination of the engine revealed that the crankshaft was fractured at the No. 4 connecting rod journal. 
The fracture surface was flat and crack arrest lines were consistent with a fatigue fracture which initiated 
subsurface. No flaws or embedded particles were observed at the site of the fatigue initiation. 
The engine was overhauled about 3 years before the accident and had accumulated 2,798 hours of 
operation since the overhaul.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to crankshaft failure as the result of a subsurface fatigue crack.
