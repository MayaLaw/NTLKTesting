Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that the airplane bounced during the wheel landing 
on the narrow, private grass airstrip. He allowed a "slight drift" to continue without applying adequate 
corrective rudder input, and the right wing collided with cornstalks that outlined the perimeter of the 
airstrip. The right main landing gear failed, and the airplane came to rest on its right wing.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.
