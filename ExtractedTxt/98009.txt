Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during approach, the airplane encountered the usual amount of sink, so he added

came to rest 1,500 ft down the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
