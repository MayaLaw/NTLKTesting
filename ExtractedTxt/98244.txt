Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while flying west to check some fields and circle a friend's house, he began a 
right, descending turn about 200 ft above ground level. He added that he was aware of power wires in 
the area, but the sun was in his eyes, and the airplane was lower than he thought. The airplane struck 
power wires and then impacted terrain.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to see and avoid power wires while maneuvering at low altitude. Contributing to the 
accident was the pilot's inability to determine the airplane's altitude due to sun glare.
