Analysis 
The pilot under instruction in the tailwheel-equipped airplane with 26-inch bush wheels reported that, 
during the approach, he saw indications of a headwind. He added that, when the airplane touched down 
on the main wheels, he noticed that the windsock had shifted and was indicating a direct left crosswind. 
Just before the tailwheel touched down, the left wing lifted, and he slowly added power to abort the 
landing. However, the airplane veered left, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the right wing 
struck the ground. The airplane exited the left side of the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and the elevator.
The airport's automated surface observing system reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind 
was from 280Â° at 25 knots, gusting to 30 knots.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing in gusting wind 
conditions.
