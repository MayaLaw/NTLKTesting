Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was attempting to perform a crosswind, soft-field takeoff from a dry, turf 
airstrip. He set the flaps to 10°, and the airplane was in a nose-high attitude until the stall warning horn 
sounded. He then relaxed pressure on the yoke until the stall warning horn stopped. Shortly after liftoff, 
the airplane entered a power-on stall, and the pilot lost airplane control, and the airplane then began to 
descend to the runway. The airplane subsequently departed the runway and impacted a barbed wire 
fence.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing strut.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane’s critical angle of attack, which resulted in a power-on stall and 
subsequent loss of airplane control.
