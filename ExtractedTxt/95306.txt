Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during an agricultural application flight, about 
800 ft into the takeoff roll on a gravel airstrip, he veered the airplane to the right to avoid hay bales that 
were stacked on the left side of the runway. He added that, as the airplane veered right, the right-wing 
spray boom encountered tall wheat, and the airplane exited the right side of the runway. Subsequently, 
the airplane came to rest nose down.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
