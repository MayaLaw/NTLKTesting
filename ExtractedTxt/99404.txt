Analysis 
The noncertificated pilot had purchased the airplane about 3 months before the accident and was flying 
the airplane for the second time. During landing, the airplane descended rapidly from about 15 ft above 
ground level (agl), landed hard, and bounced back into the air. The pilot added full power; however, as 
the airplane climbed through about 20 ft agl, it dropped rapidly a second time and landed hard. The right 
main landing gear wheel assembly separated, and the airplane veered to the right before it came to rest 
upright on the edge of the runway, resulting in substantial damage. The pilot reported that there were no 
preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation.
The pilot had obtained some flight training about 18 years before the accident in a different airplane 
make and model. He did not obtain a certificate and had not flown since then until purchasing the 
accident airplane. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilotâ€™s failure to maintain 
control during a bounced landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The noncertificated pilot's failure to maintain control following a bounced landing and his decision to fly 
the airplane without proper training.
