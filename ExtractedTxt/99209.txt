Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during cruise flight, the onboard weather radar showed unfavorable weather 
ahead, and he diverted to a nearby airport for a precautionary landing. Upon touchdown, the airplane 
veered left and slid off the runway onto an adjacent field, and the nose landing gear collapsed. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the upper engine mount. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 230Â° at 9 knots, gusting to 18 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 32.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing in gusting crosswind conditions, which 
resulted in a runway excursion and the landing gear collapsing.
