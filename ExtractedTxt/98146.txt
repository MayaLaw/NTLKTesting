Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, on short final, he "corrected the approach with a crab for a 
crosswind landing," and the airplane touched down on the first third of the runway "slightly fast" and 
left of the runway centerline. During the landing roll, the airplane gradually veered left and exited the 
runway. The pilot applied full power and initiated a go-around, but the airplane continued left and struck 
a power box. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right-wing lift strut and right horizontal stabilizer.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
An automated weather observation station located on an airport about 6 nautical miles away from the 
accident site reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was variable at 4 knots. The pilot 
reported that the wind was from the north and between about 10 and 15 knots. The pilot landed the 
airplane on runway 28. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control after landing left of the runway centerline, which 
resulted in a runway excursion and impact with a power box.
