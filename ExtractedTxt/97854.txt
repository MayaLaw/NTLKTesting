Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, after a three-point landing, the airplane began 
to "shudder" and veered left. He corrected by applying forward pressure to the control stick and right 
rudder, and the airplane's tailwheel raised off the runway, and the airplane regained the runway heading. 
As the airspeed decreased, the tailwheel touched down on the runway, and the airplane shuddered and 
veered left again. He corrected with right rudder, left brake and aileron, but the airplane ground looped 
to the left, and the main landing gear collapsed. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot added that, about 1 hour before the accident, the wind was from 340º at 12 knots, gusting to 17 
knots. The airport's automated weather observation system reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 340° at 8 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 5.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing in a left quartering headwind.
