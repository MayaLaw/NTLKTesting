Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The student pilot was conducting a supervised solo flight in the airport traffic pattern. Each of 
the previous two takeoff and landings were uneventful. During the initial climb on the third 
takeoff, the student observed the airspeed rapidly decrease. He declared an emergency, 
lowered the nose, and turned the airplane 180° to land on the runway. The airplane overran the 
end of the runway and impacted a fence, resulting in substantial damage to the windshield and 
left wing. The student’s instructor witnessed the takeoff and stated that the airplane’s angle of 
attack was excessively high and that there would have been adequate runway remaining for the 
student to land straight ahead instead of turning 180°. Postaccident examination of the engine 
did not reveal any anomalies. 
It is likely that the student pilot’s excessively nose-high pitch attitude during the takeoff 
resulted in the observed loss of airspeed.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot’s improper pitch attitude control during the initial climb, which resulted in a 
loss of airspeed, and his subsequent decision to conduct a 180° turn following the perceived 
anomaly, which resulted in a runway overrun.
