Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, during a wheel-landing, the airplane yawed 
left, and he applied right rudder to counter the yaw. The tail descended to the runway, and the left yaw 
increased. He countered the left yaw with a right brake and rudder application. He recalled that the right 
brake application was "completely ineffective" and that the airplane exited the left side of the runway. 
The airplane entered the rough gravel surface on the left side of the runway, and the pilot applied left 
rudder and left brake to intentionally ground loop the airplane. The right wing struck the ground, and the 
airplane came to a stop. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and aileron. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane's brake system by Federal Aviation Administration aviation 
safety inspectors revealed that the cotter pin and clevis that connects the right brake cylinder connecting 
rod to the inner right brake pedal connection point was detached, and it was not recovered.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The disconnection of the brake cylinder actuator rod, which resulted in the pilot's inability to maintain 
directional control during the landing roll.
