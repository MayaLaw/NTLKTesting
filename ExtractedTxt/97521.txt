Analysis 
The pilot in the retractable-landing-gear-equipped airplane reported that, during the approach, he was 
distracted by people that were on the runway and believed he "neglected to lower the landing gear." He 
added that, during landing, he thought that the propeller contacted turf, and he aborted the landing. The 
airplane gained altitude, and he turned right, but the airspeed did not increase like he felt that it should. 
Rather than continue the flight over rising terrain, he extended the landing gear and landed in a field, but 
the airplane landed hard.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear before landing, which resulted in a propeller strike, 
followed by an aborted landing and a subsequent hard, precautionary landing.
