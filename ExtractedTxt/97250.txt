Analysis 
The private pilot stated that, during approach to the airport, the weather observation system reported 
variable winds of 4 to 6 knots, which was less than forecast. While on short final approach for landing to 
runway 21, the pilot experienced "strong updrafts from unusual landforms," and when the airplane 
landed about halfway down the runway, he experienced "strong gusts causing swerving." The airplane 
was departing the side of the runway when the pilot chose to abort the landing by applying full engine 
power. The airplane was unable to outclimb the rising terrain off the side of the runway and 
subsequently impacted the ground and a fence.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. A review of recorded weather information showed winds consistently from 220Â° at 23 to 32 
knots, which would have resulted in a crosswind component of between 2 and 6 knots. The strong 
updrafts the pilot experienced would have been consistent with mechanical turbulence, which could 
have been confirmed by wind indications from the airport windsock(s).
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control during landing and during the subsequent aborted landing 
attempt in crosswind conditions.
