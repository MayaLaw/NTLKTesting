Analysis 
The pilot in the snow ski-equipped airplane reported that, during landing, just before touchdown, he 
noticed a rock sticking out of the snow near the intended touchdown point. He tried to change the 
airplane's course to the left, but the left ski contacted the snow when the airplane was not straight with 
the direction of travel, and the airplane bounced. The right ski then contacted the snow, and the right 
main landing gear strut failed. The right wing struck the ground, and the airplane came to rest.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain lateral control during landing, which resulted in the left ski impacting 
snow and a subsequent bounce and loss of directional control.
