Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was approaching his destination airport at 1,000 ft above ground level when 
the engine lost total power. After an unsuccessful attempt to restart the engine, the pilot performed a 
forced landing to a nearby parking lot, during which the airplane sustained substantial damage. A 
postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the single-drive dual magneto failed to produce 
spark due to the displacement of its camshaft. As a result, when the camshaft was positioned to neutral, 
the contact points were opened instead of closed, and when the camshaft was rotated approximately 8°, 
the points were closed when they should have been open. The magneto was then re-assembled to 
manufacturer specifications, tested, and found to produce spark on all ignition leads. The displacement 
of the camshaft resulted in the magneto not producing spark on any of its ignition leads, and a 
subsequent loss of engine power. It could not be determined if the displacement of the magneto 
camshaft was a result of an improper installation or if it moved in flight. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to displacement of the dual magneto’s internal camshaft, which 
resulted in the magneto’s inability to produce spark.
