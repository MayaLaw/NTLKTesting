Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during takeoff in a crosswind, as the tailwheel lifted off the ground, the airplane 
veered left. He applied right rudder and hard right brake, but the airplane continued to weathervane. He 
then applied full brakes and reduced power to idle, and the airplane then departed the runway to the left 
and skidded sideways on gravel before coming to an abrupt stop.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and horizontal stabilizer.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 220Â° at 8 knots, gusting to 18 knots. The pilot was departing from runway 31.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff in gusting crosswind conditions.
