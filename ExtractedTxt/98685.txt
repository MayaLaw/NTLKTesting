Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing, the airplane encountered a 
variable crosswind gust, and the left wing lifted. He was able to keep the airplane on the runway and 
established a landing roll. The ground speed was about 20 mph, and the airplane encountered another 
wind gust. The airplane weather-vaned to the left, exited the left side of the runway, rolled into mud, and 
nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the rudder.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot reported that the wind at the time of the accident was variable at 5 knots, gusting to 8 knots. A 
METAR at the nearest airport about 12 miles west of the accident site reported that, about the time of 
the accident, the wind was from 020Â° at 6 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 25.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in gusting tailwind conditions.
