Analysis 
During their descent for arrival, the flight crew of the business jet illuminated the fasten 
seatbelt sign. They cycled the seatbelt sign again when the airplane began encountering light 
turbulence. After deviating left of some adverse weather that was displayed on radar, they 
continued their descent and encountered moderate turbulence and heavy rain, during which 
the airplane dropped about 500 to 1,000 ft. Despite the flight crew having warned the 
passengers by cycling the seatbelt sign during their descent from cruise altitude, three of the 
five passengers were not wearing seatbelts during the turbulence encounter. One of the 
unbelted passengers was seriously injured, while the other two incurred minor injuries. The 
flight subsequently landed without further incident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The passengers' failure to comply with the fasten seatbelt sign, with resulted in their injury 
during an inflight turbulence encounter.
