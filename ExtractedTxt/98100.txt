Analysis 
The pilot and passenger departed on a local area flight. When the flight did not return a search 
was initiated and the wreckage was located later in the evening in hilly, uneven desert terrain. 
The wreckage debris field was contained within about a 10-foot radius of the main wreckage. 
All flight control surfaces remained attached and flight control continuity was established. The 
wing assembly was deformed in the middle section with the left portion of the wing pushed up 
and over the main spar; the right wing was pushed down. It is likely that the airplane was in an 
uncontrolled attitude at the time of impact with terrain. 
A visual examination of the engine revealed no holes in the engine case. Postaccident 
examination of the engine revealed carbon buildup in the cylinder barrels and piston faces and 
worn spark plugs. The wooden propeller remained attached to the crankshaft and engine.  
There were no mechanical anomalies revealed that would have precluded normal operation.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of control for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident examination of 
the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation.
