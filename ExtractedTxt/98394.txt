Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The certified flight instructor (CFI) reported that, during the pre-flight, a small amount of water was 
drained from the left fuel tank; no water was noted in the sample from the right tank. Following the 
departure on the instructional flight, the CFI and the pilot receiving instruction conducted several 
maneuvers before practicing touch-and-go landings; fuel tanks were regularly switched throughout the 
flight.  During the sixth takeoff, with the landing gear and flaps retracted, at about 300 ft above ground 
level, the engine lost power.  The CFI took control of the airplane, switched fuel tanks, and attempted to 
troubleshoot the engine, but he was unsuccessful. He initiated a forced landing to the runway with the 
landing gear in the UP position to avoid rolling into unknown grassy terrain. 
During the postaccident examination, some water was drained from the left fuel tank. The right fuel tank 
was free of water. The fuel collected from the fuel line going into the fuel injectors also contained some 
water. The propeller was rotated manually, and the continuity was established throughout the engine. No 
mechanical issues with the engine were noted at the time. It is likely the engine lost power due to water 
in the fuel.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of engine power due to water in the fuel lines.
