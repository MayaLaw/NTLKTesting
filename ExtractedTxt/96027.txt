Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing, after a stabilized approach, 
the airplane touched down on the main landing gear (MLG) first for a wheel landing. The airplane 
bounced twice, and shortly before the tail settled on the ground, the "crosswind increased causing the 
aircraft to weathervane to the left." He added that he increased left aileron and right rudder to keep the 
airplane on the gravel airstrip; however, the "wind gust then all but stopped as the tailwheel settled to the 
ground causing the aircraft to turn rapidly to the right." He further added that he increased left rudder 
and brake, but the MLG started to depart the gravel airstrip and enter the softer shoulder. The "tail 
swung to the left of the aircraft direction of travel," and he was unable to correct the continued 
tightening right turn. Subsequently, the airplane rolled onto the left wing and left horizontal stabilizer 
and came to rest on the MLG. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and left horizontal stabilizer.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported the wind at the accident site, about the time of the accident, as variable, gusting to 10 
knots. The pilot landed to the northeast.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing in gusting wind conditions.
