Registration:
N6107R

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a personal cross-country flight. He stated that the engine began running 
roughly during cruise flight. He leaned the mixture, and the engine roughness subsided; however, a few minutes 
later, the engine began running roughly again. He switched fuel tanks, but the engine continued running 
roughly. Shortly thereafter, the engine lost all power. The pilot subsequently conducted a forced landing in a 
soft, sandy field, and the airplane nosed over.
A postaccident engine test-run revealed that the engine would not maintain power and that the fuel flow was 
excessive. A subsequent bench test of the fuel pump revealed that the pump was set to a high fuel flow setting, 
beyond the engine’s normal limits. The fuel pump was adjusted and reinstalled on the engine for another test-
run. During the second test-run, the engine operated smoothly at a stabilized fuel flow within the operating 
limits for the engine. Given this evidence, it is likely that the engine lost power due the fuel pump’s flow setting 
being set to high, which resulted in an excessive fuel flow to the engine.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power due to the fuel pump’s fuel flow setting being set too high, which resulted in an 
excessive fuel flow to the engine.
