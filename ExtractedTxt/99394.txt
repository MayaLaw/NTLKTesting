Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the approach to land on a private, 
gravel-covered airstrip, a dust cloud obscured three-quarters of the airstrip, but the approach end of the 
airstrip remained visible. He added that, during the approach, the airplane encountered wind shear, and 
the main landing gear then impacted terrain before the approach end of the airstrip. The airplane then 
bounced and came to rest nose down.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the landing gear box.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was variable from 060° to 120° at 20 
knots, gusting to 25 knots. The pilot landed the airplane to the east.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper approach path in gusting wind conditions, which resulted in the 
airplane landing short of the airstrip and bouncing.
