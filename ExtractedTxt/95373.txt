Registration:
N7501Z

Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was conducting an aerial application flight. He was approaching a rice field after 
loading product at the company base when the engine lost partial power. The pilot executed a forced 
landing into the rice field; the right main landing gear struck a levee, and the airplane flipped inverted, 
which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. Examination of the wreckage did not 
reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane or engine and did not show any 
evidence of fuel. Although the top fuel tank was breached in the accident, the green grass around and 
underneath the wreckage did not show any evidence of fuel contamination or blight. It is likely that the 
engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion, which resulted in a forced landing on unsuitable 
terrain.
