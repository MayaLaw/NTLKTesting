Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during approach at a low level, due to "wind shear," the tailwheel-
equipped airplane suddenly lost altitude. The instructor increased the engine power to full, but the 
airplane touched down "harder than normal." The airplane impacted the airstrip with a side load, and the 
left wing and left landing gear separated from the airplane, which then slid to a stop and came to rest 
upright. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. 
The instructor reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. 
The instructor reported that the wind was from 180Â° and light and variable at 7 to 10 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's improper landing flare and failure to maintain a proper descent rate during 
approach, which resulted in a hard landing.
