Accident Number:
GAA18CA519
Date & Time:

Registration:
N45586
Aircraft:
Cessna 150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during final approach, the engine sputtered and then lost all power. The airplane 
landed short of the runway on the threshold, and the nose landing gear collapsed. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine truss and mount.
Postaccident examination by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed no evidence of 
preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A 
photograph provided by the inspector showed no damage to the propeller, which is consistent with the 
engine not producing power at the time of impact. The inspector reported that fuel was present in the 
tanks, that the gascolator screen was found clear of debris, and that he suspected carburetor ice was 
responsible for the loss of engine power. 
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 310° at 7 knots, the temperature was 72°F, and the dew point was 48°F. The atmospheric 
conditions were favorable for serious carburetor icing at descent power setting.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to carburetor icing during final approach, which resulted in a hard 
landing short of the runway and the nose landing gear collapsing.
