Date & Time:
June 5, 2017, 18:00 Local 
Registration:
N35700
Aircraft:
Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel related
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, about 1 hour after takeoff on the personal flight, the engine started "sputtering" 
and then lost all power. The pilot was unable to restart the engine and maneuvered the airplane for 
landing at a nearby airport. The airplane subsequently touched down in an open field, impacted a fence, 
and came to rest inverted in the grass, resulting in substantial damage. 
During recovery of the airplane, about 1 gallon of fuel was drained from the left wing and about 7.5 
gallons of fuel were drained from the right wing. Examination revealed no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine. The engine was satisfactorily test run several times 
during the examination. The fuel injector servo successfully passed a flow check and showed no 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures. Various fuel samples from the airplane were tested and 
no water was detected. 
The pilot initially reported that the fuel selector valve was positioned at the left tank position when the 
engine started experiencing issues, but later reported that he was using the right tank position during the 
engine issues. Given the airplane's fuel state following the accident and the lack of anomalies found 
during postaccident examination, it is likely that the loss of engine power was the result of fuel 
starvation when the pilot exhausted the fuel supply of the left wing tank. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper in-flight fuel management, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to 
fuel starvation.
