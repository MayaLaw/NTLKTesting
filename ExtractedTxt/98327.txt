Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, during a low power visual approach to land, the experimental, amateur-
built airplane became low and slow on final approach. When he increased power to arrest the descent, 
the engine did not respond, and the airplane continued to descend, stalled, and impacted the approach 
lighting system and terrain before coming to rest about 400 ft short of the runway threshold. The 
fuselage, canard, and both wings sustained substantial damage. Postaccident examination of the airplane 
did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded 
normal operation.
Weather conditions at the time were conducive to the formation of serious carburetor icing at glide 
power. The carburetor heat lever was found in the off position, and the pilot reported that he did not use 
carburetor heat for the approach to landing; thus, carburetor ice likely formed and reduced the power 
available to stop the descent into the approach lights and terrain. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to use carburetor heat in conditions conducive to serious carburetor icing at glide 
power, which resulted in a partial loss of power and an aerodynamic stall.
