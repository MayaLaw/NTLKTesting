Analysis 
According to a lineperson at the airport, the airplane was taxiing toward four fuel trucks to 
park. The lineperson then exited one of the trucks with wands, got the pilot's attention, and 
walked north away from the trucks to direct the pilot to a safer parking area. He then signaled 
for the pilot to taxi toward him, but the airplane continued north-northwest toward the trucks, 
and the engine revved to a high rpm. The lineperson then motioned for the airplane to slow 
and move away from the trucks; however, the airplane continued to taxi toward the trucks. The 
lineperson signaled stop and yelled "stop" several times. The airplane did not stop, and its left 
wing struck a light pole near one of the trucks. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions with the airplane. Although the pilot stated that while parking on the 
ramp parking area, a lineperson provided directions to taxi, which led the airplane's left wing 
to collide with a light pole, the airport director of operations reported that the pilot could not 
recall any of the wand signals that he was provided.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to remain clear of a light pole while taxiing.
