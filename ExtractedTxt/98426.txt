Registration:
N5907Y
Aircraft:
Piper PA18
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the pilot, while maneuvering the airplane in mountainous terrain, he reduced engine power 
and initiated a descent; the engine then began to cough and run roughly. He applied full throttle, and the 
engine subsequently lost total power. In an attempt to restore power, he applied carburetor heat and 
switched fuel tanks while initiating an emergency descent. The engine restarted; however, it continued 
to run roughly and would not develop full power. He continued the emergency descent and landed the 
airplane on a mountain ridge. Upon touchdown, the left main landing gear separated from the fuselage 
and the left wing struck the ground, which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing. 
A postaccident examination of the engine, which included an engine test run, revealed no evidence of 
any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
According to a carburetor icing probability chart, an airplane operating in the ambient conditions at the 
accident site could expect carburetor icing while at cruise power and at glide power. It is likely that, 
when the pilot reduced engine power for the descent, carburetor ice formed and resulted in the loss of 
engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power due to carburetor icing, which resulted from the pilot's failure to use 
carburetor heat while operating at low power settings in conditions conducive to the formation of 
carburetor ice.
