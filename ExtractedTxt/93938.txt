Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot did not receive a weather briefing before beginning the cross-country flight. After takeoff, the 
pilot requested from air traffic control to fly below 500 ft above ground level along the ocean shoreline. 
The controller approved the request but advised of heavy precipitation (a thunderstorm) at the airplane's 
12-o'clock position and 4 miles ahead. The controller further advised that the pilot should turn left and 
fly offshore 3 miles to avoid the thunderstorm. Although the pilot acknowledged the instructions, a 
review of radar and GPS data for the flight revealed that he continued on course. About 3 minutes later, 
the pilot reported the he was reversing direction, and no further communications were received from the 
pilot. Review of the airplane's GPS track overlaid on weather radar plots revealed that the airplane flew 
into an area of extreme intensity precipitation and then entered a rapid descent and impacted the ocean. 
Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions. It is 
likely that the pilot lost control of the airplane when it encountered strong downdrafts and heavy rain 
associated with the thunderstorm.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight and in-flight weather planning, which resulted in continued flight into a 
thunderstorm and a subsequent loss of airplane control.
