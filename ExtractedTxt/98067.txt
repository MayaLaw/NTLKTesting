Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During the personal flight, the commercial pilot completed several uneventful touch-and-go landings at 
two nearby airports, then returned and landed on the runway with a right crosswind at 9 knots. As the 
airplane slowed on the runway, it weathervaned into the wind and veered to the right. The pilot was 
unable to steer with the tailwheel, and the airplane exited the right side of the runway and collided with a 
tree. 
A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the tailwheel locking mechanism pins were 
worn and degraded. The locking mechanism could not withstand even a small amount of side pressure; 
as pressure was applied to the tailwheel, the locking mechanism would unlock and the tailwheel would 
swivel out of alignment. 
It is likely that, due to the degraded locking pins, the tailwheel became unlocked before the final landing 
and was out of alignment during the landing roll, which precluded the pilot from regaining directional 
control. It is the pilot's responsibility to ensure that the airplane is in a safe condition for flight; in this 
case, the pilot did not ensure that the tailwheel locking mechanism was in good working condition 
before he decided to conduct the flight.
