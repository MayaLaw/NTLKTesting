Registration:
N9368Y
Aircraft:
Beech N35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that the airplane was nearing the destination at the conclusion of a long 
cross-country flight when the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot declared an emergency 
and conducted a forced landing to a highway. During the forced landing, the airplane struck an elevated 
island and a car and was substantially damaged. 
A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed blue-colored fuel stains streaking from the right 
wing fuel filler aft to the trailing edge of the right wing flap. The right fuel tank contained 1 cup of fuel 
and the left fuel tank had about 10 gallons of fuel. The fuel cap and seat were unremarkable. An 
examination of the engine and remaining systems revealed no anomalies. 
It is likely that the right fuel cap was not seated properly before takeoff, which resulted in the siphoning 
of the fuel during the flight, and a subsequent total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The improperly seated fuel cap, which resulted in an in-flight fuel leak and subsequent total loss of 
engine power due to fuel starvation.
