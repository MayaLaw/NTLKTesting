Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor in the multiengine airplane reported that the pilot under instruction was conducting 
a simulated instrument approach in visual flight rules conditions. The instructor placed the left engine 
fuel selector in the "off" position to simulate an engine out, and the pilot under instruction initiated the 
left engine failure procedure by placing the engine and propeller levers in a simulated feathered zero-
thrust configuration. The instructor became distracted by traffic and failed to place the left engine fuel 
selector back to the "on" position. 
With full flaps and the landing gear extended and while about 250 ft above ground level, the instructor 
terminated the simulated instrument approach and instructed the pilot to land visually; however, the 
airspeed decreased below safe limits, and he instructed the pilot to increase the airspeed. The pilot 
increased power on both engines; however, the left engine power did not increase, and the airplane 
rolled to the left about 45Â°. The instructor took the controls and applied right aileron and rudder, but the 
airplane settled down in a level attitude in a shallow lagoon on the left side of the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage bulkheads.
The instructor reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation.
