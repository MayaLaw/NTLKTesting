Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during the touch-and-go landings, she observed that the student was 
struggling to maintain traffic pattern altitude and that the airplane was excessively left of the runway 
centerline. She told him that he would not be allowed to land until the airplane was on the centerline. 
During the accident landing, the airplane was left of the runway centerline, and she asked him to correct. 
He corrected, and she anticipated a full landing. During the landing flare, the airplane drifted left, and 
she instructed the student to perform a go-around. The student aggressively pitched up the airplane, and 
she heard the stall warning horn and the stall audio annunciation. She took the flight controls and 
lowered the nose, but the airplane continued to drift left. The student's statement corroborated the 
instructor's statement.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and left wing.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located about 9 miles south of the accident airport reported 
that, about 5 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 290Â° at 9 knots, gusting to 15 knots. The 
student landed the airplane on runway 34.
