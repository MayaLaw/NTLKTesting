Analysis 
The pilot was practicing instrument flight rules approaches and was returning for a landing with a light 
crosswind during dusk visual meteorological conditions. He disengaged the autopilot using the panel 
autopilot button. All flight controls seemed to perform normally. The right turn to base and right turn to 
final were made normally. On final approach, the pilot made minimal rudder inputs. As the pilot started 
to flare the airplane, he started putting in more rudder inputs. However, he could not depress the left 
rudder pedal fully. The airplane touched down about 80 knots on the main landing gear while the pilot 
was holding all the left rudder he could. The airplane started to veer to the right and continued off the 
runway, where it impacted a ditch, fence, and tree; the airplane sustained substantial damage to a wing 
and the fuselage.
The pilot indicated that the yaw damper was on when he landed. However, the airplane was equipped 
with a recoverable data module that recorded the flight's configuration and navigation data, which 
indicated that the yaw damper was off about 1/4 mile before the landing runway threshold.
Given the available information, the pilot likely did not maintain directional control of the airplane 
during the crosswind landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a crosswind landing, which resulted in the 
airplane exiting the runway and impacting a ditch, tree, and fence.
