Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, wind pushed the airplane to the right and that he 
overcompensated with left rudder. The airplane veered left, abruptly rotated about 180°, and then 
stopped on the runway at a taxiway intersection. 
The tower controller asked the pilot if he could restart the engine or if he needed a tow. The pilot 
attempted to restart the engine four to five times. While attempting a "hot start," he saw black smoke 
coming from the lower left engine cowling. He leaned forward and saw flames in the same location. The 
pilot searched for a fire extinguisher to no avail. He egressed the airplane without further incident. 
The pilot added that, during the multiple restarts, he engaged the starter for 5 to 8 seconds and estimated 
that the time between attempts was about 5 seconds. He attempted a hot start for the first couple of 
attempts. After he observed the engine fire, he attempted a flooded start.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The director of maintenance reported that the fire extinguisher was located in the seat pocket behind the 
copilot's seat.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about 7 minutes before the accident, 
the wind was from 360° at 10 knots, gusting to 17 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 10.
The Pilot's Operating Handbook, Section 3.7, "Engine Fire During Start," stated the following:
Engine fires during start are usually the result of overpriming.
