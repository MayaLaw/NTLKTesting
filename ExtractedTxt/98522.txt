Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, while observing the solo student pilot's flight from the ground, the 
approach looked good, but the airplane might have been fast. As the airplane flared, he noticed the right 
wing "kind of pop up" just before touchdown. Subsequently, the airplane landed sideways and exited the 
left side of the runway. 
The instructor added that the student was unsure of what happened but reported that he had just lost 
control.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage.
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in the airplane landing sideways and a 
subsequent runway excursion.
