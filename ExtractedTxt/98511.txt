Analysis 
The private pilot reported that he had just completed constructing the unregistered experimental, 
amateur-built airplane, and during takeoff for the airplane's first flight from the grass airstrip, he failed to 
maintain the proper pitch attitude and adequate airspeed, and the airplane experienced an aerodynamic 
stall. The airplane struck the ground nose down just beyond the end of the runway, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the forward fuselage.
The pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.
