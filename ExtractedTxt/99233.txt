Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Santa Fe, New Mexico
Accident Number:
WPR19FA106
Date & Time:
April 8, 2019, 15:38 Local 
Registration:
N118LS
Aircraft:
Tecnam P2002
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and student pilot were conducting a touch-and-go landing. Surveillance footage 
showed that, shortly after takeoff, the airplane appeared to stop climbing. The right wing then dropped 
and the airplane entered a steep, nose-down attitude and impacted the ground. A postimpact fire ensued.
Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation.
At the time of the accident, the density altitude was calculated to be about 8,600 ft. Given the available 
evidence, it is likely that the engine’s performance was degraded by the high density altitude and the 
airplane’s critical angle of attack was exceeded during the initial climb after takeoff, which resulted in 
an aerodynamic stall and loss of control.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor’s failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the initial climb after takeoff, which 
resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, an aerodynamic stall, and loss of 
control.
