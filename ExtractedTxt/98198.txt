WPR18LA246
Date & Time:
August 30, 2018, 19:02 Local 
Registration:
N2167V
Aircraft:
Cessna 140
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During the preflight inspection, the pilot determined that the left fuel tank was empty and the right tank 
contained 4 gallons of fuel (capacity 12 1/2 gallons). After discovering that the airport fuel pumps were 
inoperative, the pilot decided to proceed with the flight and remain in the airport traffic pattern.
The pilot performed a series of touch-and-go takeoff and landings and during the initial climb phase of 
the fifth takeoff, the engine lost total power. The pilot attempted a 180Â° turn back to the runway, during 
which the airplane impacted the taxiway, resulting in substantial damage.
Due to the airplane's vintage, operational and performance details such as fuel consumption and 
unusable fuel quantity were unavailable; however, a placard on the fuel gauges indicated that takeoff 
should not be attempted if the tank was filled to just under 1/4 of its capacity. It is likely that the airplane 
consumed the remainder of the usable fuel during the flight, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the 
total loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a total loss of 
engine power during the initial climb.
