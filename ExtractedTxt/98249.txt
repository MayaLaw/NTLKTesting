Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that while descending from cruise flight to traffic pattern altitude, the airplane's 
engine began to run rough. He applied carburetor heat which made the roughness worse and when he 
then turned off carburetor heat, the engine lost all power. The pilot executed a forced landing to a farm 
field where the airplane nosed over in the high vegetation. 
According to a carburetor icing probability chart, the temperature and dew point were in the range of 
susceptibility for serious carburetor icing at descent power settings. The pilot's report of the accident 
listed no mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane, and a recommendation to apply carburetor 
heat earlier at the beginning of the descent.
Based on the information available the airplane's engine likely lost power due to accumulation of 
carburetor ice due to the delayed application of carburetor heat.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The delayed application of carburetor heat by the pilot which led to accumulation of carburetor 
ice, eventual loss of engine power, and the subsequent forced landing in high vegetation.
