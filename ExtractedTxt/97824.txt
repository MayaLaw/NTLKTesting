Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during takeoff on a grass runway, after liftoff, he noticed the airplane was not 
able to climb at a normal rate. He lowered the airplane's nose, but the airspeed remained "dangerously 
low," and the stall horn sounded intermittently. He reduced power to abort the takeoff, but there was 
insufficient runway remaining. The airplane touched down and overran the runway, the left wing 
impacted a tree, and the airplane spun 180° before coming to rest.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 5 minutes after the 
accident, the wind was from 140° at 5 knots. The airplane was departing from runway 26.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to take off in tailwind conditions, which resulted in an aborted takeoff with 
insufficient runway remaining.
