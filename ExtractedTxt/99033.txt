Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing in a crosswind, he planned to 
touch down 2 ft past the beginning of the compacted, snow-covered, private airstrip. He added that, "in 
order to perform [the short field landing, he] chose to ride the tires just over the terrain until 
touchdown." He reported further that, after the front main landing gear touched down, a wind gust 
picked up the right wing, the left tire sank in the snow, and the airplane decelerated and then nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were not preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot reported that the wind at the accident location, about the time of the accident, was from 230° at 
9 knots, gusting to 15 knots. The pilot was landing the airplane to the southwest on a 210° heading.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of lateral control while landing in gusting crosswind conditions, which resulted in a 
nose-over.
