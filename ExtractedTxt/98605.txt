Analysis 
The pilot stated that, during the preflight inspection, he did not observe anything abnormal. He added 
that, during the initial taxi, the airplane "pulled more power than usual" but that he observed no issues 
with the brakes or flight controls.
The pilot reported that, during approach to a 2,300-ft-long grass airstrip about 60 knots with full flaps, 
he reduced power to idle to flare. The airplane was "still floating," and about midfield, he saw that the 
rpm had increased with the power at idle to between about 1,000 to 1,200 rpm. He retracted the flaps to 
15° to execute a go-around, but before he increased power, the airplane touched down on the runway. 
He was going to continue the go-around but realized the airplane would be unable to clear power lines 
and trees at the end of the runway. He then braked hard but was unable to stop the airplane on the grass, 
so he shut off the fuel pump and closed the mixture. He added that the "engine did not stop," and the 
airplane continued moving forward due to momentum. He applied full brakes with an "s turn and 180 
turn," the airplane slid on the grass, and the left wing struck a wooden pole. The airplane then came to 
an abrupt stop. The pilot stated that he saw that the engine and propeller had stopped
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that he attempted to examine the engine, but the 
airplane was unavailable for examination.
The airplane manufacturer's prescribed "Go Around" checklist stated:
Throttle………………………..FULL
Carb Heat……………………….OFF
Flaps……….RETRACT TO 20 DEG
