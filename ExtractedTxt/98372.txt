Analysis 
The pilot and passenger were departing the airport; a witness stated that he heard backfiring during the 
airplane's takeoff roll. He then observed the airplane become airborne and the landing gear start to 
retract. About 1 minute 30 seconds after the pilot received take off clearance, the pilot requested a return 
to the airport due to an engine problem. The air traffic controller cleared the pilot to land on runway 8L, 
and the pilot subsequently initiated a right turn. The witness then observed the airplane descend to the 
ground in a nose-low attitude. It is likely that, while returning to the airport after takeoff, the pilot failed 
to maintain the proper airspeed, which resulted in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack 
and the airplane experienced an aerodynamic stall. 
Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation and the cause of the engine problem, as reported by the pilot, could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of 
attack during a turn, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and subsequent loss of control. Contributing 
to the accident was an undetermined engine anomaly.
