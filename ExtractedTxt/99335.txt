Analysis 
The pilot, who was receiving tailwheel instruction, reported that, following a three-point landing, he 
raised the tail to initiate a go-around, but the wind shifted from a left quartering headwind to a left 
quartering tailwind. The airplane veered left. and the pilot added right rudder and aileron to correct. The 
airplane continued to veer left and then exited the runway onto tall grass and rough terrain. The 
instructor took the flight controls and aborted the go-around, and the left wing and elevator impacted the 
far side of a trench.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and elevator.
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about 5 minutes before the accident, 
the wind was from 240Â° at 3 knots and that, about 35 minutes after the accident, the wind was calm. The 
pilot landed the airplane on runway 15.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot receiving instruction's failure to maintain directional control during landing, which resulted in 
an attempted go-around and collision with a trench, and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action 
during the landing.
