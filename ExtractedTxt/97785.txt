Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, about 5 ft off the ground, the left wing raised, and the right wing 
impacted the ground. Subsequently, the airplane twisted right and landed sideways on the left main 
landing gear. 
The pilot further reported in a telephone conversation that, during the landing, the airplane got slow, 
there was a breeze from the left, and the airplane did not respond after he applied correction for lateral 
control. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the elevator.
The pilot recommended that he should have had more speed or performed a go-around.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
