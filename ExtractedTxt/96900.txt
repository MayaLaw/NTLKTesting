Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that he was providing multi-engine instruction to a private pilot who held a 
single engine airplane rating; the airplane had retractable landing gear. During the pilot's first simulated 
engine failure, single-engine approach to land, he did not extend the landing gear, and the flight 
instructor did not verify that the landing gear were extended. During the approach, both pilots heard the 
landing gear warning horn but disregarded it because of the nature of the maneuver. The airplane 
touched down on the runway with the landing gear retracted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage.
According to the Airplane Flying Handbook, page 1-6 Use of Checklist: The importance of consistent 
use of checklists cannot be overstated in pilot training. A major objective in primary flight training is to 
establish habit patterns that will serve pilots well throughout their entire flying career. The flight 
instructor must promote a positive attitude toward the use of checklists, and the student pilot must 
realize its importance.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
