Analysis 
According to the pilot, the weather began to deteriorate during the previous approach and the airplane 
encountered updrafts and downdrafts. Additionally, he noticed that it had begun to rain, and he aborted 
the landing. He reported that, during the next approach, there was a variable crosswind and that the 
updrafts and downdrafts continued. He added that, during the landing roll, the wind direction may have 
shifted to a tailwind and that the brakes did not have "the normal stopping effect." The airplane overran 
the runway and struck a fence before coming to rest on a public road. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left-wing spar. 
Ten minutes before the accident, the METAR at the airport reported that the wind was from 260° at 9 
knots and lightning was in the distance from the west to northeast. 
About the time of the accident, the wind was from 350° at 24 knots, gusting to 33 knots with a peak 
wind from 350° at 33 knots and lightning in the distance from the west to northeast. 
Ten minutes after the accident, the METAR reported that the wind was from 10° at 20 knots, gusting to 
31 knots with a peak wind from 350° at 33 knots and shifting and lightening in all quadrants with 
thunderstorms and light rain. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 23. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
