Location:
Spanish Fork, Utah
Accident Number:
GAA18CA358
Date & Time:
June 16, 2018, 10:22 Local 
Registration:
N992CT
Aircraft:
DIAMOND AIRCRAFT IND INC DA 
20
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction reported that the pilot performed a soft-field takeoff, 
and once in ground effect, he reduced back pressure, and the instructor heard the stall warning horn and 
observed a low airspeed. The instructor told the pilot to reduce the pitch, the pilot lowered the nose a 
little, but the airplane continued to climb. The instructor told the pilot to reduce pitch again, but the pilot 
stated he was concerned about a possible propeller strike. The flight instructor took the flight controls, 
but the airplane had turned to the right, and he experienced a "loss of control." The airplane landed off 
the right side of the runway, the instructor reduced power, the left main landing gear separated, and the 
airplane came to rest.
The flight instructor and pilot reported that the airplane had aerodynamically stalled.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The flight instructor and pilot both reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot receiving instruction's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the 
airplane's critical angle of attack during takeoff, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
