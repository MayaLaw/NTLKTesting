Analysis 
 
The non-instrument-rated commercial pilot departed from the operator's airstrip and was planning to 
conduct a visual flight rules (VFR) aerial application flight in an airplane that was not equipped for 
instrument flight rules (IFR) flight. Shortly after departure in visual meteorological conditions, the pilot 
contacted the operator and reported that he observed fog that was "rolling in."  The pilot reported that he 
was flying above the fog layer.  The pilot stated that he was going divert to a local airport, instead of 
returning to the operator's airstrip, and terminate the flight. No further communication was received 
from the pilot. 
Data obtained from two onboard units that contained airplane track data showed that, during the last 
several minutes of the flight, the airplane entered two spiraling turns. The second spiraling turn included 
a rapid descent from the airplane's altitude in the direction of the accident site. The airplane wreckage 
was discovered in a grass field about 7.5 miles southwest from the diversion airport. 
Two witnesses who were near the accident site heard the accident airplane flying overhead and reported 
that they did not hear any sounds associated with an airplane problem before the sound of the airplane's 
impact. An examination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical anomalies. 
The investigation was unable to determine, with the available evidence, whether the pilot had received 
an official weather briefing or accessed weather information before the flight. Multiple weather sources 
indicated low ceilings and the presence of fog, which were conducive to low IFR conditions, before and 
at the time of the accident for the area near the accident site. The witnesses who heard the accident 
airplane reported a low level of fog about the time of the accident and an area of clear visibility between 
the ground and fog. Fog differs from clouds in that the base of fog is at the Earth's surface, while clouds 
are above the Earth's surface. 
Given the weather data, airplane track data, and witness statements, the airplane likely flew into an area 
of fog just before the accident for underdetermined reasons. The IMC present at the time was conducive
