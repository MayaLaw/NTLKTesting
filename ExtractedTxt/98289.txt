Analysis 
The high-pressure turbine (HPT) uncontainment was caused by the failure of a rotating seal 
located between the HPT 1st-stage (S1) disk and 2nd-stage (S2) hub (the lenticular seal). The 
lenticular seal outer structure separated from an inner brace piece and unwound, 
destroying the turbine. Seal fragments breached the turbine cases. A fragment traveled 
forward, destroying the HPT S1 blades and penetrating the S1 turbine nozzle assembly and 
combustor, damaging a fuel nozzle stem, and releasing fuel.
 The crack initiation site was destroyed by secondary damage. Although the failure mode 
was not determined, PW2000 engine lenticular seal cracks are a known failure associated 
with knife edge tip fatigue cracks that originate at the first or second knife edge tip and 
propagate down the knife edge pedestal to the barrel. Past root cause investigations 
determined that normal knife edge rub can cause local increases in knife edge tip 
temperature when the knife edge coating is worn and has begun to spall. Continued rub 
with degraded knife edge coating creates a heat affected zone at the knife edge tip that can 
lead to thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) and tip crack initiation. TMF is more likely to 
develop with second run seals matched with new honeycomb material. 
Review of the engine service records found that the failed lenticular seal was installed new 
during a 2008 overhaul when the engine had accumulated 61,385 time since new (TSN) and 
25,462 cycles since new (CSN). The seal was visually inspected and reinstalled during a 
2013 overhaul at 74,042 TSN and 31,701 CSN. During the 2013 shop visit, 40% of the
