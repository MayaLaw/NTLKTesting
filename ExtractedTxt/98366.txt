Analysis 
The pilot of the float-equipped airplane reported that, during approach to land on a lake, he aligned the 
airplane based on wind indications on the water as well as observing other seaplanes. After the water 
landing, while slowing and coming off the step, a wind gust lifted the airplane's right wing, the left float 
hit the water, and the airplane nosed over. The pilot and pilot-rated owner egressed and were rescued by 
boaters.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing lift strut.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind was from 090° at 10 knots, gusting to 15 knots. A weather station about 
8 miles southwest of the accident site reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 
185° at 7.8 mph, gusting to 10.3 mph.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain lateral control after landing on water in gusting wind conditions.
