Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel- and ski-equipped airplane reported that, while landing off airport on a snow-

pitched forward, the tip dug into the "crusty" snow, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and lift strut.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
