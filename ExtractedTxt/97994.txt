Part 91: General aviation
Analysis 
The pilot and four passengers were nearing the completion of a cross-county business flight. While 
maneuvering in the traffic pattern at the destination airport, the controller asked the pilot if he could 
accept a shorter runway. The pilot said he could not, so he was instructed to enter a holding pattern for 
sequencing; less than a minute later, the pilot said he could accept the shorter runway. He was instructed 
to conduct a left 270° turn to enter the traffic pattern. The pilot initiated a left bank turn and then several 
seconds later the bank increased, and the airplane subsequently entered a steep nose-down descent. The 
airplane impacted a shopping center parking lot about 1.6 miles from the destination airport. 
A review of the airplane's flight data revealed that, shortly after entering the left turn, and as the 
airplane’s bank increased, its airspeed decreased to about 59 knots, which was well below the 
manufacturer’s published stall speed in any configuration.
Postaccident examination of the airframe and engines revealed no anomalies that would have precluded 
normal operation. It is likely that the pilot failed to maintain airspeed during the turn, which resulted in 
an exceedance of the aircraft's critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering in the traffic pattern which resulted 
in an aerodynamic stall and subsequent spin at a low altitude, which the pilot was unable to recover 
from.
