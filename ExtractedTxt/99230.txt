Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while on short final, about 50 ft above ground level, the airplane rolled

above ground level, but the airplane descended onto the runway, exited the runway to the left, 
and impacted terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the 
fuselage. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
