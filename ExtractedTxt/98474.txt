Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while landing on a private grass airstrip in a crosswind, a wind gust from the 
right made the tailwheel-equipped airplane weathervane into the wind. He added that, while correcting 
for the crosswind, the airplane drifted left, and the left main landing gear sunk into soft ground. The 
airplane then pivoted left, the right main landing gear exited the runway, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing, right wing spar, and left wing lift strut. 
The pilot reported that the wind was variable at 10 knots, gusting to 15 knots.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing in a gusting crosswind conditions.
