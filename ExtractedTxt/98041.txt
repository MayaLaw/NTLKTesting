Analysis 
Video from a security camera at the airport showed the airplane taxiing toward the end of the runway, 
and then the airplane was no longer in the camera's view. Shortly thereafter, the airplane came back into 
the camera's view and was seen just above the runway surface in a nearly wings vertical, nose low 
attitude just before impact with the ground.
The owner of the airplane reported that the pilot had accumulated thousands of flight hours and 
estimated that he had a total of 5 flight hours in the accident airplane. The owner also stated that the 
pilot had flown the airplane only when the wind was calm to ensure that he could understand the 
airplane and its handling characteristics. 
Postaccident examination of the airframe revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. 
The pilot's toxicology results indicated that he had taken a medically disqualifying medication. 
However, no evidence indicated that the use of the medication was a factor in the accident. 
The airplane owner stated that a strong gust of wind, at a velocity that was strong enough to shake the 
building he was in, occurred just before the accident. About the time of the accident, the wind direction 
was reported as perpendicular to the runway surface, with a wind speed of 8 knots. No gusts were 
reported. The owner of the airplane also stated that random gusts of wind were relatively common at the 
airport due to the surrounding desert terrain. Thus, it is likely that the pilot experienced an unexpected 
strong gusting crosswind and lost control of the airplane during the takeoff sequence.
