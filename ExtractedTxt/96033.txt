Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane approached with "extra speed" and ballooned in the 
landing flare. He added that, "instantly my training took over" and he applied power to go-around, but 
then also remembered he could not go around when landing in this direction, at this airport, due to 
terrain and obstacles. He further added that he then reduced power to idle and "stalled the airplane to the 
ground" and impacted the remining runway hard. Subsequently, he taxied the airplane to the ramp 
without further incident. 
The ailerons, wings, and firewall sustained substantial damage. 
During a telephone conversation with the NTSB investigator-in-charge, the pilot reported that he had 
flown into this airport numerous times prior to the accident and knew that, "once you get to the 
powerlines you are committed to landing." The power lines were located about Â¼ nautical miles from 
the runway threshold.
The pilot did not report that there were any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The Federal Aviation Administration Chart Supplement for the airport stated in part: "Land Rwy 
[runway] 28 (west) tkf [takeoff] Rwy [runway] 10 (east)." The pilot reported that the landing was on 
runway 28.
