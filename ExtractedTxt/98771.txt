Registration:
N6650M
Aircraft:
Beech 36
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot in the retractable-landing gear-equipped airplane reported that, during an instrument flight 
rules night flight, he initiated an approach in instrument meteorological conditions. During the approach, 
he saw that rime ice had accumulated on the left wing. He continued the approach, extended the landing 
gear, and then configured the flaps for landing. 
The pilot attempted to level off at 1,620 ft, although the minimum descent altitude was 1,600 ft, but the 
airplane stalled. He applied forward pressure on the yoke to lower the nose and applied full throttle. He 
recalled that the airplane was extremely slow to respond and that it was "flying on the ragged edge of 
stall." The airplane exited the clouds, and he could see the airport, but the airplane impacted a field 
about 2.4 nautical miles short of the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall 
and impact with terrain during landing in icing conditions.
