Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a day visual approach to landing on his airstrip; he stated that 
everything seemed normal on the descent. However, he noted that the agricultural irrigation pivot 
sprinkler had stopped with the sprinkler's last pipe, or "overhang pipe," over the runway. The pilot 
thought that he was high enough to clear the sprinkler overhang pipe and had "no idea" that the airplane 
was not going to clear the guy-wires that supported the sprinkler overhang pipe, and the right landing 
gear tire struck a guy-wire that was about 10 ft higher than the sprinkler overhang pipe. The airplane's 
nose subsequently impacted terrain, and the airplane came to rest inverted. The pilot reported that there 
were no mechanical malfunctions or failures during the flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain proper clearance from the sprinkler guy-wire, which resulted in the 
airplane's collision with the wire during a visual approach to landing.
