Analysis 
The pilot receiving instruction in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing roll of 
a touch-and-go landing, he added slight right correction followed by left correction. The airplane veered 
left, and the pilot added full right rudder, but the airplane ground looped to the left. The right main 
landing gear collapsed, and the right wing struck the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about 23 minutes after the accident, 
the wind was from 170Â° at 6 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 27.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing, which resulted in a ground loop, and 
the flight instructor's delayed remedial action.
