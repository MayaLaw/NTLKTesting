Analysis 
The pilot had just purchased the airplane. Before departing on the cross-country flight, he 
conducted preflight fuel planning based on the airplane’s total fuel capacity and the fuel 
consumption rate as reported by the previous owner (16 gallons and 4 gallons per hour, 
respectively). The pilot reported that, about 30 minutes from the destination, the fuel quantity 
gauges “showed low fuel,” but he thought he had adequate fuel onboard to reach the airport. 
About 15 minutes from the destination, the engine lost total power and the pilot performed a 
forced landing to a field. The airplane nosed down during the landing roll and came to rest 
upright, resulting in substantial damage to the engine firewall and mounts. 
An industry expert for the accident airplane make/model and engine configuration indicated 
that the airplane’s fuel consumption was likely about 6 gallons per hour and that the airplane 
had a total fuel capacity of 14 gallons.  During a subsequent interview, the pilot reported that 
the loss of engine power was the result of fuel exhaustion. The pilot’s reliance on the 
information provided by the previous owner likely contributed to his exhaustion of the 
available fuel. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight planning, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to 
fuel exhaustion.
