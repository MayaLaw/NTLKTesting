WPR18LA135
Date & Time:

Registration:
N6198Q

Cessna 152

Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The non-instrumented-rated pilot and pilot-rated passenger, who also did not hold an instrument rating, 
departed on a local flight and were expected to return before dark; however, they flew to another airport, 
where they refueled and departed on the return flight in night conditions. While en route, the airplane 
encountered instrument meteorological conditions and the pilot lost control of the airplane, which 
subsequently impacted terrain.
Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. The operator reported that company policy stated that pilots were prohibited from flying at 
night without explicit permission from the chief or assistant chief pilot; the accident pilots did not obtain 
such approval. Whether the pilot obtained weather information before departing on the flight was not 
determined. Although the restricted visibility conditions were conducive to the development of spatial 
disorientation, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether it played a role in the sequence of 
events. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with a loss of control in instrument 
meteorological conditions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The non-instrument-rated pilotâ€™s loss of control during an encounter with instrument meteorological 
conditions at night. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to depart on the flight without 
obtaining approval to fly at night in accordance with company policy.
