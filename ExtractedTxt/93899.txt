Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a local flight in the airplane, which he was planning to purchase. A 
witness saw the airplane initially overfly the runway from east to west, then turn back to the east and 
onto a right downwind for landing to the west on runway 25; the witness, who was a pilot, reported that 
the wind was directly down the runway about 8 knots. When the airplane was on a short final approach 
about 15 ft above the runway, it suddenly turned 90° to the right, in what the witness estimated was a 
bank angle of about 30° to 40°. The airplane continued at a low altitude toward the north perimeter of 
the airport where it impacted a stand of trees, then proceeded through the trees before coming to rest 
upright on the south shoulder of an interstate highway. Shortly thereafter, a postcrash fire erupted and 
consumed the airplane. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any 
mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The reason for the sudden right turn 
while on short final approach could not be determined during the investigation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The sudden right turn on approach to landing for reasons that could not be determined 
because postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded 
normal operation.
