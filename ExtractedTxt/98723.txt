Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, while on final approach at night, he slowed the airplane to about 87 
knots and extended 20ยบ of flaps. He then realized the airplane's altitude was low, so he initiated a go-
around, but the right main landing gear struck a fence, and the airplane impacted terrain. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. 
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain a proper glidepath during the approach, which resulted in impact 
with a fence and terrain.
