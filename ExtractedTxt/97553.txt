Analysis 
The student pilot obtained his first solo endorsement 10 days before the accident after he had accrued 
about 165 hours of flight experience. On the day of the accident, he was performing solo traffic pattern 
work, which included full-stop landings and then taxiing back for each subsequent takeoff. However, 
interpolation of radar data and the timing of the call to report the accident indicated that the pilot had 
performed a touch-and-go landing before the accident takeoff and flight.
A witness described the airplane at a low altitude and airspeed as it crossed, at treetop height, an 
interstate highway immediately beyond the departure end of the runway. The airplane then disappeared 
below the trees.
Examination of the wreckage site and the airplane wreckage revealed evidence consistent with engine 
power at impact and no preimpact mechanical anomaly. Measurement of the exposed threads of the flap 
actuator corresponded with a full-flap, 40째 extension setting.
According to the manufacturer's owner's manual, "flap settings of 30째 to 40째 are not recommended at 
any time for take-off." Thus, because the pilot took off with 40째 of flaps, the airplane was unable to 
attain the normal climb speed and entered a stall/mush from which the pilot could not recover because of 
the low altitude.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to retract the flaps following landing and the stall/mush that resulted 
during the subsequent full-flap takeoff and initial climb.
