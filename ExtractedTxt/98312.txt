Analysis 
The private pilot reported that during the approach to land after a cross-country flight, he lowered the 
landing gear and felt the gear extending into place. After visually observing the left main landing gear 
out the window, he thought that everything was normal for landing. As the airplane contacted the 
runway about 65 to 70 knots, he felt a bump from the right as the nose landing gear contacted the 
runway. The airplane veered to the right as it exited the runway, then completed a 180Â° turn before 
coming to rest in the runway safety area; the right horizontal stabilizer and right elevator impacted the 
ground and were buckled upward. The pilot reported that he did not remember seeing the landing gear 
indicator lights during the approach, nor did he hear the landing gear warning horn; however, the pilot 
was wearing a noise-cancelling headset during the flight that could have prevented him from hearing the 
warning horn. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right main landing gear was collapsed. The 
landing gear extension motor was replaced, and no anomalies were noted when the landing gear was 
tested; the warning horn sounded, and landing gear indicator lights illuminated during the testing. It was 
revealed during the examination that the landing gear extension motor on the airplane at the time of the 
accident was the original pump installed during the airplane's manufacture about 37 years before the 
accident. The motor was disassembled and had internal wear, which likely prevented the landing gear 
from fully extending and locking into place during landing.
