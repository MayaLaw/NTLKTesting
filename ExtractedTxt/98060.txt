Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot indicated that soon after takeoff for the personal flight, the airplane's engine cowling 
opened and began to swing back and forth. Concerned the cowling might fracture the windshield, he 
reduced engine power to land straight ahead, but, after realizing that the runway remaining was 
insufficient to do so, he attempted to climb and return to the runway. During his attempted go-around, 
the airplane began to descend and then impacted a cornfield off the end of the runway. Examination of 
the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have 
precluded normal flight operations. The pilot stated that he was very startled by the opening of the 
cowling, which distracted him from maintaining airspeed.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed after being startled and distracted when the engine cowling 
opened during takeoff, which led to a subsequent impact with terrain. 
Findings
