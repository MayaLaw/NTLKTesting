Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel equipped airplane stated that during landing, the airplane did not want to 
"settle" to the runway due to gusting winds. He further stated that upon touchdown the airplane ground 
looped to the left. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, right wing, and right wing 
lift strut.
The pilot reported that there were no pre impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
A review of local weather from an automated weather observation station located about 10 miles to the 
northwest, showed that about 15 minutes before the accident the wind was variable at 6 knots, visibility 
10 statute miles, and few clouds at 4700 feet above ground level. However, the pilot reported the wind at 
the accident site as 170 degrees true, 8 knots, gusts to 20 knots, and he was landing runway 18.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing in gusting wind 
conditions, which resulted in a ground loop.
