Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a touch-and-go landing, just after the airplane touched down, he reduced 
the flaps to 10° and applied full throttle for takeoff. While increasing airspeed, the airplane drifted left. 
He added right rudder, but the airplane continued to drift left, so he reduced engine power. The airplane 
then exited the left side of the runway, and the pilot briefly applied full throttle to cross a drainage ditch, 
and the airplane became airborne. Subsequently, when the airplane touched back down, the front landing 
gear separated from the airframe, and the airplane came to rest nose down.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 100° at 3 knots. The pilot was performing a touch-and-go landing on runway 24.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff with a tailwind.
