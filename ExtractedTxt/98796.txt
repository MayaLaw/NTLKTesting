Registration:
N55FN
Aircraft:
Learjet 35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Windshear or thunderstorm
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Positioning
Analysis 
The flight crew conducted an instrument approach to their destination airport that terminated in a missed 
approach. Air traffic control provided radar vectors for a second approach, and during that time, the 
wind shifted due to the passage of a cold front and favored the opposite direction runway. The 
subsequent approach was uneventful; however, during the landing flare, the airplane touched down hard 
and was substantially damaged. Review of a weather sounding taken shortly before the accident 
revealed the potential for low-level windshear activity between the surface and 1,000 feet. Given this 
information, it is most likely that the flight crew encountered windshear during the landing flare, which 
resulted in a hard landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight crewâ€™s encounter with windshear during the landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing.
Findings
Environmental issues
Windshear - Contributed to outcome
Aircraft
Landing flare - Not attained/maintained
