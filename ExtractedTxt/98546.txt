Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, during his second solo flight, while performing a touch and go, the 
airplane landed "very" hard and bounced twice before he initiated a go-around. During the subsequent 
base turn, he felt that the rudder pedals were not reacting to his commands, and he "sensed" that the 
landing gear had been damaged during the landing. Immediately after the nosewheel touched down, the 
airplane veered right and exited the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing.
