Analysis 
The pilot reported that the airspeed was slow during landing, and "when I began my flareâ€¦[the 
airplane] dropped onto the runway hard and bounced." He added full power and full right rudder to abort 
the landing, but the airplane exited the left side of the runway. The airplane became airborne, but the 
landing gear wheels encountered tall grass and the airplane did not have sufficient airspeed to stay 
airborne. The airplane descended into the mud on the left side of the runway, collided with a drainage 
culvert, and nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing, vertical stabilizer, and rudder.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control, which resulted in a runway excursion during the 
aborted landing and subsequent impact with vegetation and a nose-over.
