rudder, but the airplane exited the runway to the left and struck a runway sign. Subsequently, the 
airplane came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and empennage. 
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
