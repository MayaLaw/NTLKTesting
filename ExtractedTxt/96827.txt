Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Palatka, Florida
Accident Number:
ERA18LA097
Date & Time:
March 6, 2018, 14:30 Local 
Registration:
N45DC
Aircraft:
REILLY CHARLES W ESCAPADE
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, while on a 1-mile final approach for landing, about 400 ft above the 
ground, the engine lost total power. The pilot applied full throttle and enrichened the mixture, but only a 
momentary return of power occurred before the engine lost power again. The airspeed decreased and the 
airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and impacted a house and terrain.
Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures. The left wing fuel tank was empty, the right wing tank contained about 4 
gallons of fuel, and the auxiliary tank contained just enough fuel to cover the bottom of the tank; 
however, there was evidence of fuel spillage at the site and the amount of fuel onboard before the 
accident could not be determined. Non-volatile memory data recorded during the accident flight 
revealed a large spike in fuel flow, followed by a 0 rpm reading, which was indicative of a total loss of 
engine power due to air passing through the fuel line and transducer rather than fuel. It is likely that the 
fuel flow to the engine was interrupted, but a postaccident examination of the engine and fuel system 
could not determine what caused the interruption.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The interruption of fuel to the engine during final approach, which resulted in a total loss of 
engine power due to fuel starvation, and the pilot's subsequent failure to maintain airspeed, 
which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
