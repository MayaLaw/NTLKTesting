Analysis 
A witness reported that the pilot's first landing attempt was too high, and the airplane went around. 
During the second landing attempt, the airplane was "still too high and came in too fast." The airplane 
touched down past the runway midpoint, and as the airplane neared the end of the runway, the witness 
heard the engine "rev up" and saw the airplane depart the runway in a "very nose high" pitch attitude. 
The airplane subsequently collided with terrain about 1,000 ft beyond the departure end of the runway 
and about 75 to 100 ft below the runway surface elevation. The pilot reported that he did not recall the 
events of the accident, but stated that there were no mechanical anomalies with the airplane. The 
accident is consistent with the pilot's delayed decision to conduct a go-around  following an unstable 
approach and long landing, which resulted in the airplane having insufficient airspeed to climb after the 
attempted go-around and impact with terrain.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delayed decision to conduct a go-around following an unstable landing approach 
and long landing.
