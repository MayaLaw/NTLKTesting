Date & Time:

Registration:
N8053Q
Aircraft:
Sorrell SORRELL SNS 7
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot was receiving instruction in the experimental, tailwheel-equipped airplane. The flight 
instructor indicated they flew in the traffic pattern and then landed "normally." The pilot stated that, 
during the landing rollout, he applied the wheel brakes and the left brake "locked up." He attempted to 
keep the airplane straight, but it kept veering left. The flight instructor was unable to regain directional 
control after using corrective rudder control input; the airplane was not equipped with landing gear 
brakes at the flight instructor's seat position. The right main landing gear broke off when it hit a small 
hole, and the right wing struck the ground. A postaccident examination of the airplane was not 
performed; thus, it could not be determined whether there was a mechanical malfunction of the brake 
system.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during the landing rollout for reasons that could not be determined 
based on the available evidence, which resulted in the right wing striking the ground.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
