Analysis 
The pilot reported that he adjusted his seat and “wiggled it” prior to takeoff to ensure it was 
locked in place. However, during the takeoff roll, the seat moved all the way aft, and the pilot 
was not able to reach the throttle or the rudder pedals. The airplane veered to the left and lifted 
off the ground. Shortly after, the tail struck the ground, followed by the left wing, and the 
airplane came to rest on its nose.
A postaccident examination of the seat rail and latching mechanism revealed no anomalies. 
There was proper hole engagement with the seat pin and holes in the seat rail; the seat did not 
move once the stop was engaged with the hole. Therefore, it is likely that although the pilot 
attempted to secure his seat before takeoff, the seat pin was likely not engaged in the 
corresponding hole in the seat rail, which resulted in its aft movement when the airplane 
gained speed during the takeoff roll.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to secure his seat position prior to takeoff, which resulted in a loss of 
airplane control and subsequent hard landing.
