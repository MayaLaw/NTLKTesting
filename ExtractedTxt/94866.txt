Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel, ski-equipped airplane reported that, while landing off airport in flat light 
conditions, he was unable to maintain a good visual reference of the hard-packed snow-covered landing 
area. After touchdown, the airplane drifted off the hard-packed snow, and the left ski sunk in softer 
snow. He increased power and attempted to recover with "hard right control" to no avail. The airplane's 
left ski struck a snow-covered tank.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left-wing lift strut.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing in flat light conditions on a hard-packed 
snow-covered landing area.
