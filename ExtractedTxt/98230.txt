Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while landing on a beach, as he "relaxed" the back pressure on the yoke, the 
airplane ground looped, the right wing struck the ground, and then the left wing struck the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot added that, after examining the tracks in the sand, it was obvious that he had failed to hold 
back pressure on the yoke during the landing roll to maintain a proper soft-field technique.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain proper pitch for a soft-field landing, which resulted in a loss of airplane 
control.
