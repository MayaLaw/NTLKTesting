Analysis 
The pilot reported that he attempted to take off in the airplane from his turf airstrip. He attempted to 
force the airplane into the air, and after a brief ascent, the airplane descended to the ground and touched 
down hard. The pilot continued the sequence of lifting off and then touching down again until he 
determined that he would not be able to clear the trees at the end of the runway. He made a left turn, and 
the airplane traveled through two fields, hit a ditch, and collided with a barn. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to both wings.
Per the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot Aircraft Accident Report, the pilot reported that the 
accident could have been prevented if he had aborted the takeoff after the first bounce.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to continue to attempt to take off despite the airplane's inability to attain a positive 
climb rate, which resulted in little runway remaining, and his subsequent decision to turn off the runway, 
which resulted in a collision with a barn.
