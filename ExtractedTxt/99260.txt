Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Bethel, Alaska
Accident Number:
ANC19LA016
Date & Time:
April 11, 2019, 16:08 Local 
Registration:
N4466T
Aircraft:
Piper PA-32-300
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air taxi & commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while in cruise flight, the engine lost partial power, then total power, 
and the propeller stopped turning. 
During the subsequent off-airport forced landing on the tundra meadow, the main landing gear 
separated from the airplane, resulting in substantial damage to the right wing. 
Examination of the engine revealed a crankshaft failure that was likely a result of fatigue 
cracking that emanated from the surface of the main journal. 
The engine was overhauled at a certified repair station about 14 flight hours before the 
accident. The engine manufacturer overhaul manual stated that the crankshaft was to be 
inspected using a magnetic particle inspection procedure as part of the overhaul; however, the 
crankshaft was not inspected as part of the overhaul. It is likely that if the crankshaft had been 
inspected as indicated, the fatigue cracking would have been detected and corrected during 
overhaul.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to a fatigue failure of the crankshaft. A contributing factor was 
the inadequate inspection during the engineâ€™s last overhaul.
