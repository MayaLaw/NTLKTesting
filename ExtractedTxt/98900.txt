Analysis 
According to the passenger, the pilot fueled the airplane before takeoff. While en route, about 2,500 ft 
above ground level, the airplane struck a large bird. The engine continued to operate for about 2 
minutes, until the "low fuel" warning indicator illuminated, and then the engine lost total power. The 
pilot declared an emergency and performed a forced landing on a road. During the landing roll, the 
airplane struck a road sign and several large trees, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage 
and wings. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the nosewheel fairing and the 
underside of the engine cowling displayed evidence of a bird strike. Examination of the engine revealed 
that the carburetor was leaking fuel. The damage to the carburetor could not be definitively attributed to 
the bird strike alone. However, given that the airplane had been fueled immediately before the flight, 
that a low fuel warning was annunciated shortly after the bird strike, and that the bird had impacted an 
area in the vicinity from which fuel was leaking, it is likely that the bird strike damaged the fuel system, 
which resulted in fuel draining from the airplane, subsequent fuel exhaustion, and a total loss of engine 
power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Collision with a bird in flight, which resulted in damage to the engine, a fuel leak, and a subsequent total 
loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.
