The student pilot reported that, during a solo cross-country flight, while landing with a crosswind, the

The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport’s automated weather observation system reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 240° at 8 knots. The airplane landed on runway 27R, which resulted in a 4-knot 
crosswind.
