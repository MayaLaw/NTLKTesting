Date & Time:
August 22, 2018, 23:00 Local 
Registration:
N35442
Aircraft:
Cessna T206
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Public aircraft
Analysis 
The pilot stated that he was returning after a mission flight when he heard a "bang." The engine then lost 
power. He declared an emergency with air traffic control and received radar vectors to a nearby airport, 
but the airplane impacted a heavily wooded marsh about 3/4 mile from the runway, which resulted in 
serious injury to the pilot and substantial damage to the airplane. Postaccident examination revealed that 
the No. 4 cylinder exhaust hydraulic roller tappet was fractured and had separated. Further examination 
of the engine revealed that the No. 4 exhaust camshaft lobe and the corresponding roller tappet were 
severely worn and damaged. Additionally, the No. 4 exhaust roller tappet body ears, which supported 
the roller shaft and bearing, were also damaged, and one of the ears had fractured in fatigue. 
Metallurgical examination showed that the engine components conformed to the manufacturer's 
specifications. It is likely that the severe wear between the roller and camshaft led to nonstandard 
loading conditions, the fatigue failure of the roller tappet body ear, the subsequent liberation of the roller 
and its components, and the total loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Wear of the No. 4 cylinder exhaust camshaft lobe and roller tappet, which resulted in the failure of the 
tappet and the subsequent total loss of engine power.
