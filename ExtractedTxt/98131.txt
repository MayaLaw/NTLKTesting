Location:

WPR18TA236
Date & Time:
August 20, 2018, 17:05 Local 
Registration:
N98146
Aircraft:
Piper PA28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation
Injuries:
3 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, before the flight, he requested that the airplane be refueled, and his 
subsequent preflight inspection revealed that the airplane had been fueled to the specified level. While 
conducting touch-and-go takeoffs and landings during the instructional flight, the engine lost power 
about 300 ft above ground level, and the instructor performed a forced landing to an open field adjacent 
to the runway. The airplane impacted a fence and came to rest upright.
Postaccident examination revealed that the right-wing fuel tank contained about 7 to 8 gallons of fuel, 
with a slow fuel leak, and the left-wing fuel tank was void of fuel and undamaged. The fuel selector was 
positioned to the left-wing tank. An engine test run revealed no anomalies. Interviews with the staff of 
the fixed base operator from which the instructor ordered fuel revealed that a fuel order was received for 
the accident airplane; however, the airplane was not refueled before the accident flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the flight instructor's 
inadequate preflight inspection.
