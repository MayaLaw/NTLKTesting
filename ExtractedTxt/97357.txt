Registration:

Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while in cruise flight at an altitude of 1,500 ft above ground level, the 
experimental, amateur-built airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. He conducted a forced 
landing to a field, during which the landing gear separated, and the airplane sustained substantial 
damage. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Although the weather conditions in the area of the accident site were conducive to the formation of 
carburetor ice at cruise power settings, based on the available information, it could not be determined if 
carburetor icing played a role in the loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information.
