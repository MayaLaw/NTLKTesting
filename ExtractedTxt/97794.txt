Location:
Bismarck, Illinois
Accident Number:

Date & Time:

Registration:
N629LA
Aircraft:
Air Tractor AT 602
Aircraft Damage:

Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting an aerial application flight; a witness saw the airplane maneuvering before 
entering a flat spin. Ground scars at accident site were consistent with a wings- and nose-level impact 
attitude. Examination of the engine and airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or 
anomalies. 
The airplane was not equipped with an elevator down-spring or rudder-aileron interconnect system. 
According to the manufacturer, these systems were required and improved the stability and handling 
characteristics of the airplane. Although the circumstances of the accident are consistent with a stall/spin 
and loss of control, the reason for the loss of control could not be determined based on the available 
information; and whether the lack of the elevator down-spring and rudder-aileron interconnect systems 
contributed to the loss of control was not determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 A loss of control for reasons that could not be determined based on the available information.
