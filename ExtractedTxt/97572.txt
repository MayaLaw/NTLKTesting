Analysis 
Due to weather ahead, the pilot decided to land on a gravel strip to wait out the weather. During the 
landing roll, the tailwheel-equipped airplane became airborne after passing over a low spot on the 
gravel; the pilot increased the engine power to full to perform a go-around, but the airplane's right wing 
struck a 10 ft-tall post, which he had not seen, and the airplane impacted the ground.   
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.  
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
 
Probable Cause and Findings
