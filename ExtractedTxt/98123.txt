Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during short final, he saw a helicopter on the runway and initiated a 
go-around. During the go-around, the helicopter took off, and he believed that it was "heading directly 
for [the airplane]," which "made [him] very anxious." The helicopter departed without further incident, 
and the airplane re-entered the traffic pattern to land. During his second attempt to land, immediately 
after touchdown, the nose landing gear touched down hard, and the airplane bounced several times. 
When the airplane touched down again, the nosewheel tire blew. 
The flight instructor reported that, while watching the flight, he noted that the student did not flare the 
airplane. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount and truss.
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures 
or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard, bounced landing.
