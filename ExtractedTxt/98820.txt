Date & Time:

Registration:
N15321
Aircraft:
Piper PA28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel related
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff on the instructional flight, the engine lost total power. The flight instructor 
took the airplane controls and returned to the airport for a forced landing, during which the 
airplane landed hard on a taxiway, resulting in substantial damage. 
Postaccident examination revealed that the carburetor bowl was loose and displayed evidence 
of a fuel leak. The leak likely resulted in fuel flow irregularities and the loss of engine power. 
Although service bulletins had been published by both the carburetor and engine manufacturer 
to address this issue, there was no evidence to suggest that the accident airplane had 
undergone the inspections specified by the service bulletins. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to a loose carburetor bowl.
