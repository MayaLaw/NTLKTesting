Location:
Clever, Missouri
Accident Number:
CEN17LA110
Date & Time:
February 18, 2017, 16:57 Local 
Registration:
N6807V
Aircraft:
AEROSTAR ACFT CORP OF TEXAS 
M20E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, after takeoff on the instructional flight, the engine was running 
smoothly before it "missed" or "hesitated." The flight instructor initiated a return to the airport; shortly 
thereafter, the engine began to make loud noises and vibrate, ultimately experiencing a total loss of 
power. The flight instructor performed a forced landing to a field, resulting in substantial damage. 
Examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2 connecting rod had failed. Remnants of the 
connecting rod bearing found within the oil pan exhibited evidence of bearing failure and extrusion. Due 
to the extensive secondary engine damage, the reason for the failure of the No. 2 bearing could not be 
determined. The engine was overhauled 11 years 6 months before the accident, and had accumulated 
about 16 hours of flight time in the preceding 3 years. Guidance published by the engine manufacturer 
stated that abnormal wear could occur during engine start due to a loss of protective oil film after an 
extended period of inactivity and recommended that all engines not in continuous service be overhauled 
every 12 years. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the engine No. 2 connecting rod bearing for reasons that could not be determined due to 
the extensive secondary engine damage.
