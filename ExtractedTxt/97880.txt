Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, after a wheel landing, the tailwheel touched 
down, and it then started shaking violently. In an attempt to stop the shaking, he pushed forward on the 
control yoke to no avail. He then tried adding power, raised the tail, and let the tailwheel touch down 
again; however, the tailwheel continued to shake, and the airplane began to veer left, and he corrected by 
applying right rudder. Shortly after the airplane regained the runway heading, it suddenly veered right, 
exited the runway to the right, and ground looped. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot added that, during landing, the wind was from 010º at 4 knots. The airport's automated weather 
observation station reported that, about the 15 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 160° at 4 
knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 03.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.
