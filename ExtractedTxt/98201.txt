Loss of engine power (total)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot departed on a 35-nautical-mile flight with 9 gallons of fuel onboard. While en route, he noticed 
that the fuel quantity was decreasing faster than normal, and he elected to stop for fuel. During the 
descent toward the airport, the engine lost total power and the pilot subsequently performed a forced 
landing in a field. After touchdown, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, resulting in 
substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. 
Examination of the airplane and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies that 
would have prevented normal engine operation. About 1/2 gallon of fuel was drained from the fuel tank 
after the accident; however, an unquantified amount spilled onto the ground during recovery, and the 
amount of fuel onboard at the time of the accident could not be determined.
The right wing fuel tank was vented by a modified fuel cap. Holes were drilled in the top of the cap to 
allow air in the tank as fuel is consumed. The pilot recommended that a forward-facing tube vent be 
installed per a service letter issue by the kit manufacturer of a similar experimental, amateur-built 
airplane; however, the reason for loss of engine power and whether the modified fuel cap contributed to 
the accident could not be determined based on the available information.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information.
