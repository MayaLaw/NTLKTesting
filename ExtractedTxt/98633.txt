Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing on a dirt airstrip in calm 
winds, the airplane decelerated, but its tail would not lower. He thought it might have been due to 
slightly hard braking, so he released the brakes, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
About 2 years before the accident, the Arizona Pilot's Association and The Recreational Aviation 
Foundation issued a pamphlet about the accident airport. It stated that the airport had multiple hazards, 
including varying surface conditions and hard and soft areas. It also stated to use "at your own risk" and 
"injury and loss of aircraft are possible."
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper brake application during landing on a soft, dirt airstrip, which resulted in a nose-
over.
