Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he took off from an off-airport unimproved, 
gravel surface. He recalled that the airplane climbed to about 300 ft before it encountered a "severe 
downdraft." The airplane subsequently descended and impacted a creek bed, and the main landing gear 
separated from the airframe. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the foremost fuselage bulkhead and stringers. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind at the accident site was from 230Â° at 25 knots, gusting to 30 knots and 
that he was landing to the southwest.
Probable Cause and Findings

The airplane's encounter with downdraft conditions during takeoff, which resulted in a subsequent loss 
of altitude and collision with terrain.
