Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Controlled flight into terr/obj (CFIT)
Injuries:
3 Fatal, 1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was approaching the airport for landing following a local personal flight in night visual 
meteorological conditions when the airplane impacted 60 to 70-ft-tall trees about 1/2 mile from the end 
of the runway. Although the runway lights were illuminated at the time of the accident, the runway was 
not equipped with a precision approach path indicator (PAPI) or visual approach slope indicator (VASI) 
light system.
Examination of the airplane and the engine did not reveal any preaccident mechanical discrepancies that 
would have precluded normal operation. A review of the pilot's logbook revealed that the pilot had not 
flown at night in just over four months preceding the accident.
It is likely that, in the absence of a PAPI or VASI system by which to judge the airplane's approach path, 
the sparsely-lit terrain off the approach end of the runway may have created an illusion that resulted in 
the pilot's descent into terrain short of the runway.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from trees during a visual approach for landing in night 
visual meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's lack of recent 
experience flying at night.
