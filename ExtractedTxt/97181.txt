Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during takeoff, the solo student pilot realized he had a crosswind from 
the right and applied right aileron and right rudder. He added that, as the student rotated the airplane, it 
drifted left. The student then lost airplane control, pulled the engine power to idle, and aborted the 
takeoff. Subsequently, during touchdown, the airplane veered hard to the left and exited the runway, and 
the nose landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the accident airport reported that, about the time of the 
accident, the wind was calm. The student pilot was departing from runway 1.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain runway alignment during takeoff, which resulted in an aborted 
takeoff and runway excursion.
