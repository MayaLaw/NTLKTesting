Registration:
N224TA
Aircraft:
Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
After practicing maneuvers during the instructional flight, the flight instructor and student pilot 
approached the airport for landing. Witnesses and airport surveillance video indicated that the 
airplane entered the landing flare, but continued to float down the runway a significant 
distance, touching down about 2,800 ft down the 3,503-ft-long runway. The pilots then initiated 
a takeoff (touch-and-go). Although the published airport traffic pattern for the runway indicated 
left turns, the airplane performed a climb in a steep right bank before slowing and entering a 
spiraling decent toward a grass area near the airport terminal building. Examination of the 
wreckage did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded 
normal operation of the airplane. It is likely that the flight instructor allowed the airplane to 
exceed its critical angle of attack during a turning initial climb after a touch-and-go landing, 
which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with terrain. Although it could not be 
determined who was flying the airplane at the time of the accident, the flight instructor is 
ultimately responsible for the safety of the flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to maintain airplane control during initial climb after a touch-and-
go landing, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and an 
aerodynamic stall.
