Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the takeoff roll, the airplane was left of the runway centerline, 
and he made a “radical” correction to get back on course. After departing the runway, during 
the initial climb, he entered information into the fuel totalizer, and when he looked up 
momentarily, the airplane was in a left bank with rising terrain and powerlines ahead. 
Realizing that impact was imminent, the pilot added one notch of flaps and kept the wings 
level. The airplane impacted the ground near a ravine, resulting in substantial damage to the 
wings and fuselage.
The pilot reported, and postaccident examination confirmed, no anomalies of the airplane or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilot’s diverted 
attention during the initial climb resulted in impact with terrain. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s diverted attention during takeoff initial climb, which resulted in a collision with 
rising terrain.
