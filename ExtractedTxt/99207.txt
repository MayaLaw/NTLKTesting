Analysis 
According to both pilots in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, the newly endorsed tailwheel pilot was on 
the flight controls during the landing. The pilot at the controls recalled that, when the airplane touched 
down, it bounced, so she added power, but the airplane bounced again before it settled on the runway. 
During the landing roll, the airplane veered right, and she overcorrected to the left. She then applied 
right rudder, but the airplane became "squirrelly." The other pilot, who was the owner of the airplane, 
grabbed the yoke and applied rudder to regain directional control. The airplane decelerated, the propeller 
struck the runway, and the airplane nosed over. The other pilot reported that he did not apply the brakes. 
When asked, the pilot at the controls during the landing could not recall whether she applied the brakes.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the rudder and vertical stabilizer.
Both pilots reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll, which resulted in a propeller 
strike and subsequent nose-over.
