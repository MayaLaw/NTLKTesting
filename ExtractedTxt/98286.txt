Analysis 
The 85-year-old commercial pilot was conducting a local pleasure flight in his experimental, amateur-
built airplane. A witness near the accident site saw the airplane flying at low altitude before it entered a 
"straight up" climb followed by a descent and continued "straight down" toward the ground. It did not 
appear that the pilot attempted to pull out of the dive.
Examination of the airplane and engine revealed no mechanical discrepancies that would have precluded 
normal operation. Despite the pilot's age, his daughter stated that he had no known medical issues 
(cardiac, respiratory or physical) that would interfere with his flying, and no evidence of incapacitation 
or impairment were identified by the autopsy and toxicology testing. The reason for the airplane's 
impact with terrain could not be determined based on the available information.
