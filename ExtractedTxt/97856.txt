Analysis 
The airplane was landing on the ultralight field when the accident occurred. The pilot stated that she 
made a wide base to final turn because she was unsure about the placement of the runway. Although the 
pilot added power, the airplane entered a left descending turn until the left wing contacted the ground 
near the beginning of the runway's displaced threshold. The airplane then spun left and slid rearward on 
the ground until it contacted a chain-link fence. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation. The pilot's statement, along with a ground-based video of the accident, revealed that 
the pilot failed to maintain adequate airspeed and exceeded the airplane's critical angle of attack during 
the base to final turn, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the base to final turn and his exceedance of the 
airplane's critical angle of attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
