Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped, experimental, amateur-built airplane, he had practiced 
two takeoffs and landings and then decided to refuel the airplane. After refueling the airplane, he flew 
one more pattern before flying to his home airport. The pilot stated that, during the landing flare, the 
airplane "seemed as if it was being pushed down." The left wing struck the runway, the airplane landed 
on the right main landing gear, and the airplane then bounced. The propeller struck the ground, and the 
airplane exited the right side of the runway and then stopped.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing spar.
The METAR at the airport about the time of the accident reported that the wind was calm.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing.
