Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, while taking off for a stop-and-go landing, he applied full power, 
and the airplane drifted left. He corrected with right rudder, but the airplane continued left. He reduced 
power to idle to abort the takeoff, but the airplane "continued out of control to the left." He applied 
brakes and opposite rudder, but the airplane exited the runway to the left and struck an airport sign, the 
left main landing gear separated, and the airplane came to rest about 200 ft past the sign.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing lift strut.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff, which resulted in a runway 
excursion and impact with a sign.
