Analysis 
The pilot reported that he experienced a loss of engine power at or below 500 ft above ground level 
during departure turnout from the runway. The pilot attempted to restart the engine, but the airspeed 
continued to decay, and he ejected. The airplane then impacted the water and became submerged in the 
ocean about 2.86 nautical miles southeast from the departure end of the runway in an area with a water 
depth of about 250 ft.
Postaccident examination of the recovered wreckage revealed that all recovered components were fully 
functional at the time of the accident. Because the rest of the wreckage was not recovered and could not 
be examined, the reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings

A total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
