CEN16LA343
Date & Time:

Registration:
N1726D
Aircraft:
Cessna 170A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting a personal flight, and his last recollection of the flight was when he entered the 
traffic pattern for the runway. He stated that he was unsure if he "had a bad landing or tried to go 
around" when the accident occurred. The airplane came to rest upright in the grass alongside the runway 
facing southeast; the forward fuselage was crushed aft, which was consistent with a nose-down impact. 
The flaps were found fully retracted. A postaccident examination of the runway did not reveal any tire 
skid marks that could be associated with a loss of directional control after the airplane touched down. 
The initial point of impact was where the left wingtip had hit the ground about 30 ft from the left edge of 
the runway. The propeller exhibited damage consistent with minimal engine power at impact. The 
wreckage examination did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. Based on the available information, the pilot lost airplane control, but 
it could not be determined if this occurred while landing or during a go-around attempt.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control, which resulted in impact with terrain near the runway.
