Analysis 
During the takeoff roll, the pilot realized that his headset active noise reduction (ANR) function was 
inoperative. He tugged on the headset cord to access the ANR control module, but the module was stuck 
between his seat and the center console, and he returned his attention to continuing the takeoff. When 
the airplane was about 200 ft above ground level, the pilot engaged the autopilot, then leaned down to 
focus on freeing the control module. A few seconds later, and without freeing the module, the pilot 
noticed a significant decrease in engine noise and power. He sat upright, verified that the engine power 
and mixture levers were correctly positioned, and began scanning the instrument panel, but was unable 
to restore engine power. About the same time, the aural "sink rate" warning began sounding.
Based on the airplane's low altitude and his evaluation of the surrounding terrain, the pilot chose to 
deploy the airframe parachute system, even though the airplaneâ€™s height above the ground was below the 
minimum recommended deployment altitude. The airplane impacted the ground under canopy, resulting 
in substantial damage to the fuselage.
It is likely that, during his attempt to free the headset control module, the pilot inadvertently and 
unknowingly repositioned the unguarded three-position fuel pump control rocker switch, located on the 
center console, to the HIGH BOOST/PRIME position. This selection resulted in the loss of engine 
power.
