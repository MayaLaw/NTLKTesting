Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and student pilot were practicing a simulated engine failure. After 
completing the emergency checklist, the student added engine power to recover from the 
maneuver about 500 ft above the ground, but the engine did not respond. The flight instructor 
took control of the airplane, verified the fuel selector position, and landed. The atmospheric 
conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to the development of carburetor icing at 
glide (idle) power settings, and the instructor reported that he did not apply carburetor heat 
during the simulated engine-out or attempted recovery. Based on the available information, it 
is likely that the loss of engine power was the result of the accumulation of carburetor ice 
during the idle-power descent and that the use of carburetor heat would likely have prevented 
the loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power due to carburetor icing, and the flight instructorâ€™s failure to 
effectively use carburetor heat while operating at an idle engine power setting in conditions 
conducive to carburetor icing.
