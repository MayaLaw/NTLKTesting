Analysis 
On October 9, 2018, about 2300 EDT, Southwest Airlines 2235, a Boeing 737-700, N287WN, was 
enroute to Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (KCLT), Charlotte, North Carolina, when a flight 
attendant was burned with hot liquid. Of the 93 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant 
received a serious injury.  The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under 14 
Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Nashville International Airport (KBNA), Nashville, 
Tennessee, to KCLT.
As the flight attendant (FA) was conducting cabin service, she tripped over a passenger's knee, causing 
her to spill her beverage tray. One of the beverages was a hot tea, and it splashed on her left forearm and 
on the passenger's shoulder and arm. After landing, paramedics treated both the passenger and flight 
attendant at the gate, however, both declined to be transported to a local hospital for further 
examination.  The following day the FA was still in pain and went to a local medical clinic where she 
was diagnosed with a 2nd degree burn to her forearm.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
flight attendant tripping over a passenger's knee that resulted in hot liquid splashing on the 
flight attendant.
