Analysis 
The private pilot was taxiing the airplane and receiving progressive taxi instructions from an air traffic 
controller. The pilot indicated that he asked if he should turn onto the taxiway and was instructed to do 
so. However, instead of proceeding on the taxiway, which had a continuous painted yellow centerline, 
the pilot turned left onto a vehicle service road, which had a painted white "stop" marking and an 
adjacent stop sign. The underside of the airplane's left wing subsequently struck the stop sign, which 
resulted in substantial damage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadvertent navigation onto a service road instead of a taxiway, which resulted in a collision 
with a stop sign.
