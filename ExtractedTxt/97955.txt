Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot departed on a cross-country, personal flight, and during the flight, he chose to fly at 
low altitude over a river. The pilot reported that, after passing over a group of river rafters about 500 ft 
above ground level, he "dropped [the airplane] low to the river." Shortly after descending, the airplane's 
vertical stabilizer struck a cableway that crossed over the river. The pilot lost airplane control, and the 
airplane subsequently impacted the side of the river canyon and then came to rest partially submerged in 
the river. 
The cableway was supported by two fixed A-frame structures located on the sides of the riverbank, and 
the cable height at its center above the water's surface was 32 ft. The pilot likely was not properly 
monitoring the environment during the low-altitude operation, which resulted in his failure to see and 
avoid the cableway. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to conduct a low-altitude flight over a river and his inadequate monitoring of the 
environment, which resulted in a collision with a cableway.
