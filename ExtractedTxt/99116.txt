Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that he became distracted and did not extend the landing gear before landing at the 
airport. The airplane slid on the runway, which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing's rear 
spar. Although the airplane was equipped with a gear warning horn, both the pilot and the passenger said 
the horn did not sound. The gear warning horn had been functionally checked during the last annual 
inspection and was also tested after the accident with no anomalies noted; thus, the investigation could 
not determine why the pilot and passenger were unable to hear the horn.

The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear, which resulted in a gear-up landing.
