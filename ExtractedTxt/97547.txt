Analysis 
After climbing to cruise altitude, the pilot noted that the landing gear position indicator lights showed 
that the landing gear were not retracted, and the pilot was unable to fully extend or retract the gear. He 
declared an emergency and landed with the landing gear retracted, resulting in substantial damage to the 
horizontal stabilizer. 
Examination revealed that the rigid hydraulic line connecting the hydraulic powerpack to the bulkhead 
had failed at the ferrule. A review of maintenance records revealed that this line had recently been 
duplicated and replaced due to a failure in the same area. The reason for the failure was not determined 
based on the available evidence.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of a hydraulic line in the landing gear system, which resulted in the pilot's inability to lower 
the gear and a subsequent gear-up landing.
