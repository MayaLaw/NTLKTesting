Analysis 
According to the pilot, during initial climb, about 90 ft above ground level, the airplane flew through a 
flock of canary-size birds. He reported that, after the bird strikes, the airplane continued to climb, but the 
"prop then became unbalanced causing a violent vibration," followed by a steep left bank and then a 
right bank. He recalled that the airspeed decreased, and the stall warning horn sounded, and about 5 
seconds later, the airplane impacted a body of water adjacent to the airport in a 60Â° left bank. 
Photographs provided by Federal Aviation Administration aviation safety inspector showed that the 
airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The airplane's collision with multiple birds during initial climb, which damaged the propeller and 
resulted in a subsequent aerodynamic stall because the airspeed could not be maintained.
