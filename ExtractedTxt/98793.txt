Analysis 
The pilot departed on an instrument flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). 
Radar data indicated that the airplane entered a left turn after takeoff, consistent with the pilot's 
instrument clearance. As the airplane climbed to an altitude about 2,410 ft above ground level, its rate of 
climb increased from about 3,500 ft per minute to 9,600 ft per minute, the stick shaker activated, and the 
airplane decelerated to about 75 knots. The airplane then entered a descending right turn and rolled 
inverted before impacting terrain about 1 mile from the airport. All major components of the airplane 
were located at the accident site, and examination of the wreckage revealed no anomalies with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The weather conditions about the time of the accident included an overcast cloud ceiling about 600 ft 
above ground level. It is likely that the pilot became spatially disoriented after entering the cloud layer, 
which resulted in the airplane's high rate of climb, rapid loss of airspeed, and a likely aerodynamic stall. 
The steep descending right turn, the airplane's roll to an inverted attitude, and the high-energy impact are 
also consistent with a loss of control due to spatial disorientation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of airplane control due to spatial disorientation during initial climb in 
instrument meteorological conditions.
