Analysis 
The private pilot of the Piper airplane with a passenger on board was landing while the student pilot of 
the Diamond airplane with a flight instructor on board was performing touch-and-go landings on an 
intersecting runway in day visual meteorological conditions. Both airplanes were flying in left traffic 
patterns for their respective runways at the uncontrolled airport. The pilot of the Piper and the student 
pilot of the Diamond stated that they announced every leg of the traffic pattern on the airport's published 
common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The Diamond landed, and just when the student was adding 
power to initiate a takeoff, the left wing of the Piper, which was landing and flaring just a few feet above 
the runway, impacted the tail of the Diamond. The flight instructor in the Diamond said he was looking 
for the Piper after he saw it flying in the vicinity of the airport but that he never saw it in the airport 
traffic pattern, while the pilot of the Piper did not report seeing the Diamond until just before the 
collision. Recordings of the airport's CTAF showed that radio calls from the Diamond were heard for 
every leg of the airport traffic pattern on the published CTAF frequency before the collision, but only 
two garbled radio calls from the Piper were heard on the published CTAF frequency. Postaccident 
examination of the Piper's transceiver revealed that it was set to a different frequency. The Piper's 
transceiver was then set to the correct CTAF frequency, and the communication was clear. Therefore, it 
is likely that the pilot of the Piper failed to use the correct CTAF frequency when he announced his 
airplane's position in the airport traffic pattern.
