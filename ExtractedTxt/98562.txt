Location:
FiIlmore, California
Accident Number:
WPR19LA016
Date & Time:
October 27, 2018, 10:45 Local 
Registration:
N6834R
Aircraft:
Cessna T210
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that, after a normal departure, he climbed the airplane to a cruise altitude about 4,000 ft 
mean sea level (msl) and configured it for cruise flight. Thereafter, the engine experienced a sudden total 
loss of power. Despite his attempts to troubleshoot the failure, he could not restart the engine and 
performed a forced landing in a dry riverbed. After touchdown, the nose landing gear impacted a rock 
and collapsed, and the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted.  
Examination revealed a cloth towel blocking the turbocharger inlet tube that had become entangled with 
the turbocharger compressor wheel. The towel likely blocked the inlet air from reaching the cylinders, 
which resulted in a loss of engine power. The pilot stated that during the last oil change, about 34 flight 
hours before the accident, he removed the airbox and placed a towel in the inlet scat tubing (not 
disconnected) in an effort to protect the turbocharger from foreign object damage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power as a result of the pilot’s failure to remove a towel from the engine’s air 
induction following maintenance.
