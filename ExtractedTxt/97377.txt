Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after conducting multiple uneventful landings, he was returning for a full stop 
landing. He stated that the touchdown on the main wheels was normal, but immediately after the nose 
wheel contacted the asphalt surface, the airplane veered sharply to the left, exited the improved runway 
surface, and encountered an area of soft sand. The nose wheel separated from the fuselage, and the 
airplane subsequently nosed over, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage, vertical 
stabilizer, and rudder.  
The airplane's wreckage was disposed of without the National Transportation Safety Board's knowledge 
or consent. Because the airplane was not available for examination, it could not be determined if a 
mechanical failure or malfunction occurred. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of directional control during landing for reasons that could not be determined based on the 
available evidence, which resulted in a runway excursion. 
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained
