Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during touchdown, the tailwheel-equipped airplane bounced and veered right. He 
overcorrected with left rudder, and the airplane veered left, so he applied right rudder, but the airplane 
continued left. He then applied full power to go around, but the airplane departed the runway, struck a 
perimeter fence, and nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in the airplane bouncing and a subsequent loss of 
directional control, a runway excursion, and impact with a fence.
