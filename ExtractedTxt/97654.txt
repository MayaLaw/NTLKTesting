Analysis 
According to the pilot, he inadvertently failed to retract the wheels of the amphibious airplane after 
takeoff from a hard surface runway. Upon arrival at his destination, he did not use the Before Landing 
checklist, and when the airplane touched down on the water with the wheels extended, it nosed over. 
The amphibious airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing lift strut, the empennage, the 
right wing aileron, the rudder, and the elevator. 
The pilot asserted that the accident was pilot error and that the accident could have been prevented if he 
had he used the checklist.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the amphibious airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.

over when the airplane landed on water with the wheels extended. Contributing to the accident was the
