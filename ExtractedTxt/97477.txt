Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during the landing flare, the gear-retracted warning horn sounded. 
The propeller struck the ground, and he applied full throttle and initiated a go-around. The engine began 
"bucking," so he decided to lower the landing gear and land on the remaining runway. He applied 
forward pressure to the yoke to level the airplane, but the airplane touched down hard and came to rest 
upright, off the left side of the runway.
The student reported that he should have verified the configuration of the landing gear before landing. 
He added that he did not use a prelanding checklist. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to extend the landing gear before landing and to follow the Before Landing 
checklist, which resulted in an attempted go-around and subsequent hard landing.
