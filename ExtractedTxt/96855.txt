Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a three-point landing, the tailwheel touched down first, and as the main 
landing gear touched down the airplane bounced. He applied more back pressure on the yoke, and as the 
airplane settled on the main landing gear it veered to the left. He applied right rudder and brake to no 
avail. Subsequently, the right wingtip struck the ground, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing, the right-wing lift strut, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system located at the accident airport reported that, about the time 
of the accident, the wind was from 010Â° at 6 knots. The pilot landed on runway 9.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a loss of directional control and a nose-over.
