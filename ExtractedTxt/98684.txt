Registration:
N579CP
Aircraft:
Cirrus SR22
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Ferry
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a ferry flight, while climbing the airplane to cruise altitude, the engine 
temperatures increased quickly and that the engine then surged. The pilot added that he "switched" the 
boost pump, adjusted the mixture lever, and then deployed the ballistic parachute system at 3,500 ft 
mean sea level. During the off-airport landing in a field, the airplane impacted an irrigation sprinkler 
system.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
Postaccident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed 
that two air lines were disconnected and that there were no torque lines on the lines. According to the 
FAA inspector, the pilot and a mechanic who had conducted the airplane's last maintenance reported that 
the airplane had been flown 7 hours since the last maintenance. The mechanic had replaced three 
cylinders during the maintenance, which required removal of the air lines. It is likely that, during the 
maintenance, the mechanic did not properly secure the air reference line, which led to a loss of engine 
power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The mechanic's failure to properly secure the air reference line, which resulted in a loss of engine power.
