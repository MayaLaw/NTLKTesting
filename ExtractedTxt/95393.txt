Analysis 
The private pilot prepared to hand-prop the airplane, which was not equipped with an electrical starter, 
by tying the tail down with a nylon rope. The pilot then hand-propped the engine, which started at a high 
power setting. The airplane moved forward, breaking the rope, and continued to taxi in circles. The pilot 
and another individual tried to stop the airplane; however, the propeller struck the pilot, resulting in fatal 
injuries. The airplane eventually came to stop farther down the runway.  Although the pilot attempted to 
secure the airplane by tying down the tail, the throttle was set at a high engine power setting, allowing 
the airplane's movement.
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper starting procedure before hand propping the engine, and his subsequent attempt to 
stop the moving airplane, which resulted in him being struck by the propeller.
