Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while landing uphill at an off-airport 
unimproved landing site where he had landed before, he applied the brakes, and that the airplane then hit 
a "bush or a bump," which caused the tail to rise. Subsequently, the propeller struck the ground, and the 
airplane nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the empennage, fuselage, and wing spars.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain pitch control on uneven terrain during the landing roll, which resulted in a 
nose-over.
