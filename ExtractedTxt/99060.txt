Accident Number:
ERA19TA120
Date & Time:
March 5, 2019, 15:15 UTC 
Registration:
N345DM
Aircraft:
Cirrus SR22
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that the yellow low oil engine pressure light illuminated about 2 hours into 
the flight while the airplane was at 8,000 ft mean sea level. The analog oil pressure gauge 
confirmed the low oil pressure reading of 25 psi. The oil pressure continued to drop, and the 
pilot notified air traffic control of the situation. As the oil pressure dropped to 2 psi, the engine 
vibrated strongly and the propeller stopped. The pilot established best glide speed and 
deployed the airplane parachute system about 1,500 ft above the water. The airplane landed in 
the water in an upright position. The life raft was inflated, and the pilots egressed from the 
airplane and were subsequently rescued by a passing cruise ship about 2 hours later. The 
airplane was not recovered from the ocean, which precluded a postaccident examination.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of oil pressure and subsequent total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
