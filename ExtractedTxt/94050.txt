Analysis 
According to the student pilot, following the first leg of his solo cross-country flight, he entered the 
traffic pattern to land on runway 17 "because other traffic was using runway 17 even though winds were 
050Â° at 3 knots." 
He reported that, as the airplane approached the runway, the airspeed was too high, and the airplane 
landed hard on the nosewheel and porpoised. He conceded, "I knew it was a hard landing, but did not 
hear the prop strike occur." 
The student pilot departed the airport and accomplished two approaches and a landing at a third airport 
before returning to his home airport where he accomplished two approaches, a landing, and then taxied 
to parking. 
The student pilot reported that he could have prevented the accident by performing a go-around when he 
realized that his approach speed was too high. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall.
The student pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with the engine or 
airframe that would have prevented normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard, porpoised landing.
