Analysis 
During a telephone interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-
charge, the pilot reported that he "landed around 80 knots" and "didn't get the flaps down" before 
landing. He further reported that the airplane "didn't want to stop" and that it then "ran off the runway." 
During the runway excursion, the nosewheel collapsed, and the airplane nosed over.
The fuselage, wings, and vertical stabilizer sustained substantial damage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
An automated weather observation station located 28 nautical miles west from the accident site reported, 
about the time of the accident, wind from 170Â° at 7 knots. The landing was on runway 36.
The pilot did not submit the NTSB Form 6120.1 Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident Report.
A witness reported that he was at the airport in a hangar and noticed that the accident airplane was 
"high, fast, and downwind." He added that he observed the airplane overrun the runway and nose over 
into the grass.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to continue an unstabilized approach for landing in tailwind conditions, which 
resulted in a runway overrun and a nose-over.
