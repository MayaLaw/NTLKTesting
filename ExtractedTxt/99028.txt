Piper PA28

Loss of engine power (partial)

Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the pilot, the airplane accelerated normally during the takeoff roll, became airborne, and 
the engine started to run "rough." He elected to land straight ahead on the remaining runway. The 
airplane subsequently overran the runway and collided with the perimeter fence. Examination of the 
airplane revealed it sustained substantial damage to the airframe.
During an examination of the left magneto, two ignition wires in the distributor cap revealed evidence of 
arcing, and one ignition lead was found detached from the insulator and spring. The right magneto was 
removed, rotated, and produced spark at each spark lead. The metal copper electrode on the right 
magneto distributor gear was found loose.
To address a potential decreased service life of Slick 4-cylinder magneto distributor gear assemblies, 
Slick/Champion Aerospace Service Bulletin SB1-15A calls for replacing distributor gear assemblies that 
have a copper electrode with assemblies that have a Monel electrode. A rough running engine was a 
symptom of the condition that the SB was intended to address. A review of the accident airplaneâ€™s 
maintenance logbooks revealed no entries for the repair of the magnetos or compliance with the 
applicable SB and that the airplane received three annual inspections since the release and the revision 
of the SB.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the magnetos due to a known deficiency, which resulted in a partial loss of engine
