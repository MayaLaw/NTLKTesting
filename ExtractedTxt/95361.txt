Analysis 
The private pilot stated that, immediately after takeoff, the left wing felt "extremely heavy" and required 
"an exceptional amount of right aileron" to maintain level flight. During the precautionary landing, the 
airplane bounced, turned left, and the left main landing gear collapsed.
The pilot had recently reinstalled the wings; however, he made no measurements during the 
reinstallation, and the mechanic who signed off on the condition inspection did not confirm the wings' 
angle of incidence. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the angle of incidence was 
incorrect. Given this was the first flight since the reinstallation of the wings, it is likely the incorrect 
angle of incidence led to the pilot's difficulty controlling the airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's difficulty controlling the airplane due to his incorrect reinstallation of the wings, which led to 
a bounced precautionary landing. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the pilot and the 
mechanic to verify the wings' angle of incidence.
