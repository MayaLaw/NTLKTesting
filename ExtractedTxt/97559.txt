Date & Time:
June 24, 2018, 11:15 Local 
Registration:
N94070
Aircraft:
Ercoupe 415 D
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot and a pilot-rated passenger departed on a local flight to complete touch-and-go 
landings at a nearby airport. The airplane was in the traffic pattern when witnesses reported that the 
airplane flew very low over their house and that the engine was "sputtering and backfiring." The airplane 
flew about 30 ft above them, made a steep left bank toward the airport, then impacted the ground in a 
wooded area. A postimpact fire consumed a majority of the airplane; the propeller exhibited signatures 
consistent with a lack of engine power at impact.
Although impact and thermal damage precluded a detailed examination of the engine and fuel system, 
examination did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction or abnormalities that 
would have led to a loss of engine power. The investigation was unable to determine the cause of the 
loss of engine power based on the available information. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
