Registration:
N75SY
Aircraft:
COSTRUZIONI AERONAUTICHE 
TECNA P2002 SIERRA
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while landing in a crosswind, the approach was "too low," and he added power. 
The airplane then "rolled and veered" left. He added that marks on the terrain indicated that the left wing 
struck the ground, and tracks showed that the airplane touched down on the pavement before the runway 
threshold. The airplane then exited the runway, the nose landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to 
rest nose down.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount, left wing, and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system located at the airport reported that, about the time of the 
accident, the wind was from 330Â° at 8 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 30.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glidepath and crosswind correction during landing, which 
resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
