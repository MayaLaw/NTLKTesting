Location:
Clovis, New Mexico
Accident Number:
CEN18LA207
Date & Time:

Registration:
N66ML
Aircraft:
Cessna T210
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that he departed for the local flight in the airplane with 17 gallons of fuel in 
the right fuel tank and 22 gallons of fuel in the left fuel tank. While he was descending the airplane 
through 6,500 ft mean sea level and drawing fuel from the right tank, the engine lost total power. The 
pilot switched to the left fuel tank, turned on the fuel pump, and engaged the engine starter in an attempt 
to restart the engine to no avail. The pilot subsequently conducted a forced landing, during which the 
airplane collided with a power line, and the left aileron and fuselage sustained substantial damage. 
Examinations of the airframe, fuel system, and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation, and the engine was 
test-run successfully. At recovery, 2 gallons of fuel were found in the left fuel tank (although a small 
amount had leaked from the damaged fuel drain), and 9 gallons of fuel were found in the right fuel tank. 
The investigation could not determine the reason for the engine power loss. 
The Pilotâ€™s Operating Handbook engine restart procedures stated, in part, to select the fuller fuel tank. 
Given that there was adequate fuel onboard when the engine lost power, if the pilot had properly 
conducted the engine restart procedures by selecting the fuller fuel tank, it is possible that engine power 
could have been restored.
