Analysis 
While the accident airplane was inbound for landing, the pilot received traffic and wake turbulence 
advisories from air traffic control for a crossing heavy Boeing C-17 on approach. The pilot 
acknowledged that he had the C-17 in sight and elected to execute a 360Â° turn. After completing the 
turn, he descended the airplane below the altitude of the C-17, ultimately crossing 3.66 miles behind and 
about 500 ft below the C-17's flightpath. Shortly after passing behind the C-17, the pilot reported 
entering an area of "severe turbulence," which he described as "one violent instantaneous motion." The 
airplane continued for a landing. 
The pilot reported that, during a postflight inspection of the airplane, he discovered that both wings and 
the horizontal stabilizer exhibited signs of buckling. Further, the left wing had shifted aft, which reduced 
the gap between the trailing edge of the flap and the fuselage by 3/8 of an inch. A crack in the left wing 
spar was discovered during a subsequent, detailed postaccident examination. Federal Aviation 
Administration guidance indicates that pilots should fly at or above the preceding aircraft's flightpath, 
altering course as necessary, to avoid the area behind and below the generating aircraft.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to avoid wake turbulence from a crossing heavy airplane.
