Analysis 
The pilot reported that he initiated a takeoff roll on the 2,200-ft-long wet, turf runway, and that, about 
1,650 ft down the runway, the airplane encountered standing water, and the speed decreased. He 
reported that he "still felt I had plenty of room to regain airspeed and take off safely." The airplane 
encountered standing water again on another section of the runway, and the speed decreased further. The 
pilot retracted two notches of flaps and attempted to climb the airplane, but it exited the departure end of 
the runway and entered a cornfield. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mounts.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision not to abort the takeoff after the airplane encountered standing water on 
the runway, which decreased its speed and led to its subsequent inability to climb and resulted in a 
runway overrun.
