Analysis 
The airline transport pilot was conducting a tour flight with two passengers onboard and landed on a 
hilly sand dune. He reported that the wind increased by 10 to 20 knots over a 2-hour period. The pilot 
said that, after considering and reviewing several downhill departure routes, he selected a departure 
route that was into the wind. Just after a downhill takeoff, the headwind diminished, the airplane stopped 
climbing, and the stall warning horn sounded. The airplane subsequently collided with rising terrain, 
which resulted in substantial damage to the forward fuselage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot selected an unsuitable takeoff area with 
unfavorable wind conditions, which likely resulted in the airplane's inability to maintain a climb.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of an unsuitable takeoff area with unfavorable wind conditions, which resulted in 
the airplane's inability to maintain a climb.
