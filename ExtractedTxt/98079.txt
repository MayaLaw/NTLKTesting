Analysis 
On July 31, 2018, about 1315 eastern daylight time, American Airlines flight 89, a Boeing 757-223, 
N192AN, experienced a hard landing at Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. There were no injuries to the 181 passengers and crew onboard. The airplane was 
substantially damaged. The regularly scheduled international passenger flight was operated under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Shannon International Airport (SNN), 
Shannon, Ireland, to PHL.
The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The flight crew stated that 
the ILS 09R approach was normal and the airplane landed in the touchdown zone. The captain stated 
that as the airplane touched down the nose pitched up abruptly when the spoilers auto-deployed but that 
he quickly countered the pitch up and flew the nose back on to the runway.  As the flight was taxiing to 
the gate a flight attendant called on the interphone to inform the crew that they had heard an unusual 
noise during landing.
At the time of landing, the winds were reported to be from 130 degrees at 5 knots, with no gusts.
Postflight examination of the airplane found that the aft pressure bulkhead was buckled. The skin was 
worn through around Station (STA) 1720 to the pressure bulkhead, and the skin was wrinkled from STA 
1701 to STA 1743 and Stringer 23L to 23R.
