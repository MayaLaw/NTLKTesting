Location:

Accident Number:
CEN19LA064
Date & Time:
December 28, 2018, 20:15 Local 
Registration:
N6202M
Aircraft:
Cessna 152
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was conducting a personal, cross-country flight with one passenger onboard. The 
pilot reported that, about 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 hours into the flight, the engine started to lose power. The pilot 
contacted air traffic control for vectors to the nearest airport. The pilot then checked the gauges and 
applied carburetor heat. The engine initially responded; however, a few minutes later, the engine lost all 
power, and the pilot's additional attempts to restore power were unsuccessful. The pilot did not think 
that the airplane could reach the nearest airport, so he established a glide for an off-airport forced 
landing, during which the airplane impacted trees and terrain and sustained substantial damage.
During recovery of the airplane wreckage, the fuel tanks were found intact and empty. Additionally, 
there was no evidence of fuel leakage on the ground. The pilot reported that the airplane ran out of fuel 
and that the accident could have been prevented by better calculation and review of distance, fuel, and 
time in flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight and in-flight fuel planning, which resulted in the total loss of engine 
power due to fuel exhaustion.
