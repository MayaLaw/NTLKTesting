Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Ferdinand, Indiana
Accident Number:
CEN18TA233
Date & Time:
June 18, 2018, 22:45 Local 
Registration:
N3002X
Aircraft:
Cessna 150F
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot and passenger were on a cross-country personal flight at 2,500 ft mean sea level and 
were about 15 miles north of their destination airport. They began the descent, and during the descent, 
the engine sputtered, followed by a total loss of power. The pilot attempted to troubleshoot the loss of 
power but was unsuccessful; however, he did not apply carburetor heat during the troubleshooting. 
Subsequently, the pilot made a forced landing to a parking lot. During the landing roll, the airplane 
impacted an embankment and nosed over. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that fuel was present in the fuel tanks and the fuel 
lines to the carburetor. Examination revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failures or 
malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Weather conditions at the time of the 
accident were conducive to the accumulation of serious carburetor icing at glide power settings. It is 
likely that, during the descent, carburetor ice accumulated due to the pilot's failure to apply carburetor 
heat, which resulted in the loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to apply carburetor heat in conditions conducive to the accumulation of carburetor 
icing, which resulted in a total loss of engine power.
