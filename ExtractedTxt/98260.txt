Analysis 
The flight instructor and student pilot were performing touch-and-go takeoffs and landings on 
runway 14. The instructor stated that the second touch-and-go “went bad,” but he could not 
remember the events of the accident. The student pilot did not provide a statement. The 
recorded weather conditions at a nearby airport about the time of the accident included wind 
from 160° at 17 knots with gusts to 23 knots, resulting in a 7-knot right crosswind component 
for the landing runway.
The airplane came to rest inverted about 1,800 ft down the 3,000-ft-long runway. The wing 
flaps were in the fully extended position, and examination of the flight controls revealed no 
anomalies. The runway displayed impact markings consistent with contact from the left wing 
about 1,700 ft down the runway and to the right of the runway centerline. The circumstances of 
the accident are consistent with a loss of directional control during a touch-and-go landing in 
gusting crosswind conditions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of directional control during a touch-and-go landing in gusting crosswind conditions.
