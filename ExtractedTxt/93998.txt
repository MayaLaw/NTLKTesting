Analysis 
The pilot performed touch-and-go landings and go-arounds, then flew about two miles from the airport 
to practice stalls. After performing three stalls, he was climbing the airplane through 800 ft above 
ground level and returning toward the airport when the engine lost total power. The pilot established 
best glide speed and attempted to restart the engine to no avail. He made a left turn toward a nearby 
road, but when he tried to level the wings, the left wing remained low. He applied full control stick and 
rudder in an attempt to level the wings, but the airplane continued a left slip toward the ground, where it 
landed hard and slid to a stop. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined based on 
the available information.
