Analysis 
The commercial pilot, who was experienced in aerobatics, coordinated with a friend to perform a flyover 
of a cattle branding event. Before departing on the flight, the pilot informed his father and that he was 
feeling very ill and nauseated during the previous flight that day due to in-flight turbulence and informed 
his friend at the branding event that he may not be able to perform the flyover. The pilot subsequently 
flew to the cattle branding event and commenced aerobatic maneuvers, which included a loop and 
rolling maneuver followed by a climb in a vertical pitch attitude. The airplane subsequently rolled left 
and entered a left-turning spin, which continued to ground contact. 
Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures 
that would have precluded normal operation, and autopsy and toxicology testing of the pilot identified 
no evidence of physiological impairment or incapacitation. Although the pilot had reported some 
symptoms before departing on the flight, the nature of his illness was not diagnosed, and no evidence of 
illness was identified on autopsy. It is possible that the pilot's undefined symptoms or illness may have 
contributed to the accident; however, without further evidence, it could not be determined whether or to 
what extent his symptoms may have affected his ability to recover from the spin maneuver. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to recover from a spin for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information.
