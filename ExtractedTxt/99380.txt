Analysis 
The pilot of the biplane reported that, while on short final, immediately after crossing the end of the 
runway and while about 10 ft above ground level, he increased the throttle setting to maintain 60 mph. 
He added that, about 5 to 8 ft above the ground, the airplane "sank rapidly" and landed hard, and the 
right landing gear collapsed. Subsequently, the airplane veered right, exited the runway, and nosed over. 
The biplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the biplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare with a left crosswind, which resulted in a hard landing, collapsed 
landing gear, runway excursion, and nose-over.
