Analysis 
According to the flight instructor in the light sport airplane, the pilot in the left seat had not flown for a 
while and was receiving instruction to complete a flight review. The airplane was equipped with a single 
control stick. During the landing flare, the pilot applied forward stick, and the airplane impacted the 
runway hard. The nose landing gear and the right main landing gear collapsed. The airplane exited the 
right side of the runway and came to a stop in the grass safety area. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mounts and lower fuselage. 
The instructor asserted that he should have refused to instruct in an airplane with only one control stick.
Both pilots reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
