Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was maneuvering to perform an agricultural application. He noticed a ground 
application operator was located inside of the cab of the ground application equipment. The pilot 
decided to perform a "close fly-by" over the ground equipment. The left main landing gear struck the 
ground equipment cab, and the pilot chose to return to the airport. He landed on the gravel taxiway that 
paralleled the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left main landing gear 
attachment points.
Per the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot Aircraft Accident Report, the pilot reported that the 
accident could have been prevented if "the pilot [had] used better judgement and not done a close fly-by 
the ground application equipment," which was also owned by the operator. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to perform a low altitude fly-by over ground equipment, which resulted in 
the airplane striking the equipment.
