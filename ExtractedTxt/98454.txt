Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that, while en route to his destination, the airplane's engine sputtered and then 
lost total power. During the subsequent forced landing to a highway, the airplane landed hard, 
and the landing gear collapsed; the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. A 
postaccident examination of the engine revealed the No. 3 cylinder exhaust valve fractured 
where the stem transitioned to the valve head seat. The valve head impacted the No. 3 piston 
and became lodged between the crankcase and the camshaft, which resulted in the fracture of 
the camshaft. Fatigue cracking, which initiated at multiple sites, propagated through the valve 
stem. The presence of a tapered stem near the fracture surface, high temperature oxide 
deposits, and fatigue striations on the fracture surface suggested that the stem underwent 
spallation or erosion of the oxides formed during high temperature exposure, which would 
reduce the stem cross-section over time, increasing the likelihood of initiating fatigue cracking. 
Additionally, a localized area of wear on the top face of the valve stem was most likely due to 
the valve not rotating during operation, which could create hot spots or improper thermal 
dissipation in the hottest parts of the valve and lead to valve damage or failure.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The fatigue failure of the No. 3 cylinder exhaust valve, which resulted in a fractured camshaft 
and a total loss of engine power.
