Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during the takeoff climb from a grass runway with the student pilot 
flying, about 25 ft above ground the "climb rate became stagnant." He added that he instructed the 
student to "lower the nose slightly," but after "several seconds the airplane did not resume a normal 
climb rate." The flight instructor took the flight controls and noticed that they were "sluggish" and it felt 
as if the airplane was caught in "wind swirls" and downdrafts. Subsequently, the flight instructor made a 
"small left turn" toward a small gap in the tree line ahead and the airplane impacted a heavily 
wooded/treed area.
The fuselage and both wings sustained substantial damage. 
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
According to the flight instructor, the airplane departed "loaded at gross weight." The student pilot 
reported that the flight instructor did not discuss weight and balance with him before flight.
During postaccident interviews with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, 
the student and flight instructor each reported their personal weight and a total of 10 gallons of fuel on 
board at takeoff. Based upon the information provided, the takeoff weight was 1,389 lbs, which was 139 
lbs over the maximum gross weight (1,250 lbs) published in the airplane Pilot's Operating Handbook. 
The airplane's center of gravity for takeoff was within limits at 18.65 (12.4 to 22.0). 
An automated weather observation station 8 nautical miles (nm) southwest of the accident site reported 
that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 200° at 5 knots, temperature 82°F (28°C), 
dewpoint 54°F (12°C), and barometric setting of 29.76 inches of mercury. The calculated density 
altitude 8 nm southwest was 2,648 ft. The flight instructor reported that they took off from runway 20, 
which was 2,600 ft long.
