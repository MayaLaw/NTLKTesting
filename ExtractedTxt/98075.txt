Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Westbrook, Minnesota
Accident Number:
CEN18LA332
Date & Time:
August 15, 2018, 11:45 Local 
Registration:
N5521X
Aircraft:
Aero Commander S2R
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that the airplane experienced a loss of engine power at rotation during 
takeoff. The airplane cleared a soybean field off the end of the runway and then a two-lane road before 
entering a corn field on the opposite side of the road. The airplane traveled about 300 ft into the corn 
field with 8-ft-tall corn before nosing over and coming to rest. A postaccident examination did not 
reveal any anomalies consistent with a loss of engine power or a mechanical failure or malfunction of 
the flight control system.
Engine monitor data revealed that the accident takeoff was the fifth takeoff of the day. At the beginning 
of the takeoff, the engine speed and torque increased smoothly to full power. About 50 seconds after the 
takeoff began, the engine speed and torque decreased abruptly over 3 or 4 seconds consistent with the 
encounter with the corn field.
The distance that the airplane traveled into the corn field was consistent with normal acceleration under 
full engine power during the takeoff run. The engine monitor data revealed that the engine was 
producing full power until encountering the corn field with no evidence of a loss of engine power. Thus, 
because the available evidence indicated that the airplane was operating normally at the time of the 
accident, the investigation was unable to determine why the runway excursion occurred.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A runway excursion during takeoff for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
evidence.
