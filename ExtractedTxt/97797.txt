Analysis 
After landing at the destination airport, the pilot smelled smoke, so he shut down the airplane, exited, 
and saw a fire in the vicinity of the baggage compartment. The fire consumed most of the fuselage and 
the inboard portion of both wings. The pilot recently had a lithium-ion battery installed in the emergency 
locator transmitter (ELT). However, the ELT and battery were examined and determined not to be the 
source of the fire. Investigators were not able to determine the origin of the fire due to the extent of fire 
damage.
