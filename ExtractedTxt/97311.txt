Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that he was conducting a postmaintenance flight in the experimental amateur-built 
airplane in the traffic pattern. While landing, he applied full throttle to go around, but when the airplane 
was about 150 ft above ground level, the engine lost total power. During the forced landing, the airplane 
landed long, bounced, descended into a fence, and came to rest inverted, which resulted in substantial 
damage to the fuselage and both wings. 
The engine had been altered from its original state by the addition of an after-market, high-displacement 
cylinder/piston kit to increase performance and horsepower of the engine. The kit, as installed, replaced 
the crankshaft, camshaft, engine gaskets, cylinders, and pistons. The pilot stated that he had been 
discussing with the kit manufacturer a problem with fuel flow to the engine and, thus, altered the fuel 
supply system with larger fuel lines. No modifications were made to the carburetors. 
Because the carburetors were not altered, it is likely that the engine was not receiving enough fuel for 
full power operation, which resulted in a total loss of engine power during the go-around attempt.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An inadequate fuel supply to the engine, which resulted in a total loss of engine power and subsequent 
impact with terrain.
