Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during a night landing, the student pilot relaxed back pressure, and 
the nose landing gear struck the runway. The airplane bounced, and the instructor took the flight controls 
and settled the airplane back onto the runway. They then taxied off the runway and did not see anything 
wrong with the airplane, so they continued two more takeoffs and landings without further incident.
During the 100-hour inspection the next day, it was observed that the airplane had sustained substantial 
damage to the fuselage.
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing.
