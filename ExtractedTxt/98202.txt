Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, before landing on the narrow, gravel airstrip, 
the airplane encountered a wind gust from the right that "pushed me to the left a few feet." The airplane's 
left wing contacted brush on the left side of the airstrip, and the airplane then exited the left side of the 
airstrip. The airplane descended into a 2-ft-deep ditch and stopped. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing spar.
The pilot reported that the wind conditions were variable and gusting to 8 knots, that the skies were 
clear, and that the visibility exceeded 10 miles.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilotâ€™s failure to maintain directional control during landing in gusting wind conditions.
