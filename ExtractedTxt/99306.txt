Analysis 
The pilot landed the seaplane into an easterly wind, then noticed that the surface wind was 
greater than forecast. Unable to taxi to the beaching location, he elected to return to his 
destination. He maneuvered the airplane into the wind and applied takeoff power. He 
described the takeoff run as "bumpy" and the water conditions as "rough." The pilot reported 
that the left float departed the airplane at rotation speed, and the airplane subsequently nosed 
into the water. The pilot and passengers were assisted by a nearby vessel and the airplane 
subsequently sank into 50 ft of water. Inclement sea and wind conditions prevented recovery of 
the wreckage for 52 days, and the wreckage was stored outside for an additional 13 days before 
recovery by the salvage company. Extensive saltwater corrosion prevented metallurgical 
examination of the landing gear components; however, no indication of a preexisting 
mechanical malfunction or failure was found.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to attempt a takeoff in rough sea conditions, resulting in damage to the 
floats and the sinking of the seaplane.
