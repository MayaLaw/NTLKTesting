Analysis 
After completing the preflight inspection, the pilot reported a normal engine runup and recalled 
checking the carburetor heat and magnetos twice before takeoff. He started the takeoff roll and noticed 
that the roll was a "little longer than normal” and that the airplane’s climb performance was poor. He 
applied carburetor heat, noted a loss of rpm, then turned the carburetor heat off. Shortly thereafter, the 
airplane started to descend, and the pilot performed a forced landing to a field. 
Examination of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
that would have precluded normal operation. The atmospheric conditions at the time of the accident 
were conducive to the formation of serious carburetor icing at cruise power settings. Since postaccident 
examination of the engine revealed no anomalies, it is likely that the loss of power was a result of 
carburetor ice accumulation. It is possible that carburetor ice formed before departure, when the engine 
was operating at a low power setting, which resulted in a partial loss of engine power during the initial 
climb.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power during initial climb due to carburetor icing, and the pilot's failure to 
effectively use carburetor heat in conditions conducive to the formation of carburetor ice.
