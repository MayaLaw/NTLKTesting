Analysis 
The pilot reported that, 15 minutes into a cross-country flight, the airplane's engine lost rpm. He added 
power, and the engine regained rpm briefly before losing all power. The pilot selected a dirt road for an 
emergency landing, during which the nose landing gear touched down on a soft surface, and the airplane 
nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left and right wings and the front windshield.
The pilot reported that the airplane had 4.5 gallons of fuel on board at the last takeoff. A Federal 
Aviation Administration inspector reported that, during postaccident examination of the airplane, the 
fuel tanks were found empty. The gascolator had residual fuel, and about 1 gallon of fuel was removed 
from the fuselage fuel drain. He added that, according to the manufacturer's specifications, the airplane 
should have had 1.5 gallons of unusable fuel. He turned on the airplane's master power switch to view 
the fuel quantity gauge indications, and the left-wing tank gauge indicated between empty and a quarter 
full with no fuel in the tank, and the right-wing fuel tank gauge indicated empty.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a subsequent total 
loss of engine power.
