Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during short final, while approaching the runway threshold, he reduced the 
engine power to maintain glideslope, added full flaps, and applied a little left rudder to maintain the 
runway heading. Subsequently, the airplane sank and landed hard, and the nose landing gear collapsed.   
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both engine mounts, the right wing, tail, and rudder.
The pilot also reported that, before the approach, an air traffic controller advised him that the wind at the 
destination airport was from 190° at 14 knots, gusting to 18 knots. The airport’s automated weather 
observation station reported that, about 10 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 200° at 14 
knots. The airplane landed on runway 14.
The Airport Facility Directory advised, "Steep drop off north of runway 14."
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare in crosswind conditions, which resulted in a hard landing.
