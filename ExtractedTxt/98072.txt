Public aircraft
Analysis 
The accident airplane was one of three public aircraft that were supporting firefighting 
operations. The three airplanes had made four successful water drops and had just scooped 
water from a river to make a fifth drop. The airplanes were in a climb en route to the drop 
location when the pilot of the accident airplane heard a “loud bang” followed by a total loss of 
engine power. The pilot made a forced landing to treetops in a heavily forested area.
During the on-site examination, a coat of oil was observed on the cowling and one of the wings. 
Damage was also observed to the engine. The engine examination revealed that a second-stage 
power turbine blade exhibited fatigue signatures, and molten debris was identified throughout 
the engine. The debris was subsequently identified as environmental particles, but the source 
of the debris was not determined from the available evidence for this investigation. The loss of 
engine power was likely due to the accumulation of foreign melted environmental debris on the 
engine’s hot section components, which resulted in the first- and second-stage power turbine 
blades fracturing from tensile overload.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power during a climb due to an accumulation of molten environmental 
particles, the source of which could not be determined based on the available evidence, which 
resulted in a forced landing.
