Registration:
N3HH
Aircraft:
Avid Avid Flyer
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was in cruise flight when the engine lost partial power, then total power. He restarted the 
engine and briefly regained partial power, but shortly thereafter, the engine again lost all power. The 
pilot performed a forced landing to a road, during which the airplane sustained substantial damage.
A test run of the engine indicated no anomalies; however, further inspection revealed a stuck float 
needle in the carburetor and a clogged carburetor vent line, which could have led to an excess vacuum in 
the carburetor and restricted fuel flow. It is likely that this restriction caused a transient condition that 
resulted in the loss of engine power that was not replicated during the test run. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to a carburetor malfunction, which resulted in a forced 
landing.
