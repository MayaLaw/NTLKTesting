Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and student pilot were conducting an instructional flight. As the student turned the airplane 
from the base leg to the final leg of the traffic pattern, the engine lost total power, so the instructor assumed 
control of the airplane. He attempted remedial actions to no avail, so he chose to conduct a forced landing to a 
railroad bed before the approach end of the runway. The airplane landed hard, which resulted in the right main 
landing gear and nose landing gear separating from the airplane. 
Fuel drained from the airplane during recovery contained large quantities of water. After recovery, a fresh 
source of fuel was plumbed into the fuel system, and the engine started and ran smoothly. Given that the 
engine was successfully test-run with fresh fuel after the accident, it is likely that the loss of engine power was 
due to water contamination of the fuel supply.
Probable Cause and Findings

Water contamination of the fuel supply, which resulted in a total loss of engine power.
