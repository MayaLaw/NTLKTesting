Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, the airplane veered right. He applied left rudder, and the 
airplane straightened out, but it then began to veer right again. He stated that he then overcorrected with 
excessive left rudder control and that the right wingtip impacted the runway. The right-wing trailing 
edge spar was substantially damaged. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's loss of directional control during the landing roll and his subsequent overapplication of left 
rudder, which resulted in the right wing impacting the runway.
