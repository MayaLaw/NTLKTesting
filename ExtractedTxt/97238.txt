Analysis 
According to the pilot in the low-wing airplane, he was cleared by ground control to taxi to runway 22R 
via "Alpha and November." Taxiway Alpha runs parallel to runway 22R. The pilot approached taxiway 
Alpha via taxiway Mike, and before entering the intersection of taxiways Alpha and Mike, he "looked in 
all directions for aircraft" and then proceeded to turn left onto taxiway Alpha without stopping. His 
airplane's right wing collided with the left side of another airplane already taxiing via Alpha to 22R. He 
asserted that the other airplane was moving very fast when the collision occurred. His airplane sustained 
substantial damage to the right aileron.
