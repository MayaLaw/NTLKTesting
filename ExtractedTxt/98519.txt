Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was practicing flight maneuvers before returning to the departure 
airport. As he approached the airport, he entered on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern for 
a touch-and-go landing. After the touch-and-go landing, while the airplane was climbing out 
and accelerating, the engine began to “sputtering” several times and then lost power 
completely. The pilot performed a forced landing to trees below and the airplane’s wings and 
fuselage were substantially damaged. Postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal 
evidence of any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal 
operation.
Based on the pilot’s description of the fuel onboard at the time he departed, and the duration of 
the flight, sufficient fuel should have been available when the loss of engine power occurred. 
The pilot also reported that at the time of the loss of engine power, the carburetor heat was off. 
He did not report activating it prior to or following the time the engine began losing power. The 
temperature and dew point at the time of the accident was conducive to the formation of 
carburetor icing. Given this information, it is likely that the loss of engine power was due to the 
formation of carburetor ice during the approach to landing and subsequent takeoff. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to utilize carburetor heat in conditions conducive to the formation of
