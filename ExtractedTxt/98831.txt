Piper PA46

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that the airplane began to pull to the left shortly after touchdown. He 
applied corrective control inputs, but the airplane continued to veer left and departed the 
runway, and the main landing gear collapsed.
Examination did not reveal any anomalies with the steering system that would have precluded 
normal operation, and all appropriate service bulletins had been complied with. The nose gear 
actuator had detached at an area on the airframe that was prone to fatigue failure; however, 
examination of the actuator assembly revealed that it had detached during an overload event, 
likely from the impact as the airplane departed the runway.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of directional control during the landing roll for reasons that could not be determined 
based on the available information.
