Analysis 
According to the student pilot, he was performing touch-and-go takeoffs and landings following his first 
cross-country solo flight. He reported that, during his last landing, the airplane touched down "all the 
way to the right side of the runway," so he aborted the landing. He shut off the carburetor heat and 
applied power, and the airplane's nose pitched up and turned left. The airplane impacted the grass safety 
area on the left side of the runway in a nose-down attitude. The airplane came to rest inverted after 
striking a drainage culvert and sustained substantial damage to the right-wing lift strut and aileron.
The student reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the aborted landing.
