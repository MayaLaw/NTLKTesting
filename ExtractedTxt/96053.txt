Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while performing a wheel landing on an 
unimproved gravel airstrip, a wind gust lifted the "weight off of [the] tires and initiated a skid." He 
added that, as the airplane settled back on the airstrip, the tail rose rapidly due to the brakes being 
applied, and the airplane nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing lift strut and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's overapplication of brakes, which resulted in a nose-over.
