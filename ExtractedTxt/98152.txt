Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Hanson, Massachusetts
Accident Number:
ERA18FA230
Date & Time:
August 24, 2018, 15:35 Local 
Registration:
N65HM
Aircraft:
Aeronca 7AC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Fatal, 1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot and passenger were departing on a local personal flight in the single-engine 
airplane. Review of airport security video showed the airplane level off about 100 ft above ground level 
as it passed the departure end of the runway. The airplane then entered a left turn and descended to 
ground contact. Damage to the propeller blades was consistent with a lack of engine power at the time of 
impact; however, examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies 
that would have prevented normal engine operation. Based on the temperature and dew point about the 
time of the accident, the conditions were favorable for serious carburetor icing at a glide power setting.
Video showed that the airplane operated on the ground at an idle engine power setting for about 7 
minutes before takeoff, and it is probable that carburetor ice formed during this time, subsequently 
resulting in the loss of engine power during the initial climb. Following the loss of power, the pilot 
attempted to turn back to the runway with insufficient altitude and, during the turn, failed to maintain 
airspeed, resulting in an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, an aerodynamic stall/spin, 
and impact with terrain.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to carburetor icing, the pilot's decision to turn back to the runway 
shortly after takeoff, and his failure to maintain airspeed during the turn, which resulted in an 
exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, and subsequent aerodynamic stall.
