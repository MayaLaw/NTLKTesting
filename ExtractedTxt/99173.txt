Analysis 
During the climb to cruise altitude on a cross-country flight, the pilot heard a loud bang and the pilot's 
side windshield shattered and the cabin began depressurizing. The pilot returned to the departure airport 
and landed uneventfully, where he noticed that the seal was extruded in two places around the outer 
pane. The windshield was sent to the manufacturer for a detailed examination, which revealed that 80% 
of the fiberglass straps were missing, and they were likely removed by maintenance personnel. A 
combination of missing straps and heavy delamination caused the outboard ply to become detached from 
the edge attachment. Moisture ingress at the bottom aft edge caused delamination and arcing.  There was 
no record in the airframe logbook of the strapsâ€™ removal.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Improper maintenance of the windshield, which resulted in delamination and in-flight depressurization.
