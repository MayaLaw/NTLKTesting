Analysis 
The pilot noted no anomalies during the preflight, engine start, or runup inspections. However, 
shortly after takeoff, while on the crosswind leg of the traffic pattern, the engine lost power and 
the propeller stopped turning. The pilot prepared for a forced landing to a clearing and 
deployed the airplaneâ€™s parachute system. The airplane impacted a tree just prior to landing. A 
visual examination of the engine at the accident site revealed no obvious holes in the engine 
case, and fuel was observed leaking from the fuel pump and fuel filter. Further examination of 
the fuel pump and fuel filter revealed no mechanical anomalies. The reason for the loss of 
engine power could not be determined based on the available information.
