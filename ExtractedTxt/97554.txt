Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, during an agricultural application flight, he 
accidentally loaded more fertilizer to disperse than he had initially planned, which made the airplane 
"heavy." He chose not to add fuel to prevent the airplane from being over its gross weight. During flight, 
the engine lost power, and the pilot conducted a forced landed in a dirt field that was water-logged due 
to recent storms. During the landing roll, the airplane nosed over. The pilot reported that "I misjudged 
what I believed to be a safe quantity of fuel remaining."
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the rudder and vertical stabilizer.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the subsequent total 
loss of engine power.
