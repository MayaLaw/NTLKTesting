Analysis 
The pilot and passenger had recently completed maintenance work on the engine to address engine 
sputtering that occurred during steep climbs. A witness who was familiar with the troubleshooting stated 
that, on the day of the accident, the pilot's plan was to complete steep climbs to determine why the 
engine sputtered during that maneuver. The wind was from the south at 15 knots and gusting to 25 
knots; the airplane departed to the south into the wind. The witness reported observing what he 
considered a "normal" takeoff, followed by a steep 15 to 20 second climb. At the top of the climb, the 
nose and left wing suddenly dropped, and the airplane entered a left-turning spiral, completing 3 to 4 
slow rotations before impacting the ground. The witness stated that the engine sounded normal the 
whole time and he did not notice anything wrong.
The airplane impacted the ground in a nose- and left-wing-low attitude and came to rest upright. A 
postimpact fire consumed a majority of the airplane. A postaccident examination of the airplane did not 
reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation; however, the examination was 
limited due to the extent of the fire damage.
The accident circumstances are consistent with pilot executing a steep climb to troubleshoot an engine 
issue. During the steep climb in gusting wind conditions, the airplane's critical angle of attack was 
exceeded which resulted in an aerodynamic stall, and spin into terrain.
