Analysis 
The pilot reported that he initially attempted to take off, but the airplane was not accelerating fast 
enough and he aborted the takeoff. The pilot then decided to take off from a longer runway at the 
airport. When the airplane was about 100 ft above ground level, he observed that it was not continuing 
to climb. The pilot-rated passenger/owner stated that the stall warning horn sounded. The airplane began 
to lose altitude and subsequently collided with a stand of trees. The airplane came to rest inverted and 
sustained substantial damage to both wings, the forward fuselage, and the empennage. The pilot reported 
that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that 
would have precluded normal operation and that the airplane's weight was about 50 lbs less than its 
maximum gross takeoff weight. The pilot-rated passenger reported that he thought that the high density 
altitude was the cause of the accident. 
The calculated density altitude was about 8,600 ft at the time of the accident. According to the Federal 
Aviation Administration Koch Chart, given the surrounding temperature and field elevation, the airplane 
would have likely experienced a 68% decrease in the normal climb rate. Thus, it is likely that the 
airplane did not have sufficient airspeed to climb in those conditions.
