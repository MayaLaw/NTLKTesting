Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the takeoff roll in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, with the tailwheel 
raised, a wind gust from the right lifted the right wing. The pilot overcorrected with right aileron control, 
and the right wing and horizontal stabilizer contacted the runway surface. The airplane subsequently 
veered off the runway to the left and came to a stop.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the right wing and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system located on the airport reported that, about 13 minutes before 
the accident, the wind was from 220° at 10 knots, gusting to 20 knots. About 13 minutes after the 
accident, the wind was from 200° at 8 knots, gusting to 19 knots. The pilot landed on runway 22.
