Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing, a crosswind lifted the left 
wing, and the airplane drifted right. The right main landing gear encountered the grass on the right side 
of the runway, and the airplane subsequently nosed over and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing lift strut, right aileron, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 8 minutes after the 
accident, the wind was from 150Â° at 10 knots, gusting to 16 knots. The airplane landed on runway 19.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing in gusting crosswind conditions.
