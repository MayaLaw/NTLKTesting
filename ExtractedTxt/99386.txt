Analysis 
The pilot and his pilot-rated passenger conducted a landing on a turf airstrip when the airplane pulled to 
the right as it slowed. The pilot was able to make a full stop landing and taxi back to take off. The 
takeoff was uneventful, so he remained in the airport area for another landing. During that landing, the 
airplane pulled hard to the right as it slowed. The pilot initiated a balked landing and returned to the 
original departure airport. During the final landing the airplane touched down on centerline for what 
initially appeared to be a normal landing. However, shortly after landing the pilot was unable to 
maintain directional control of the tailwheel equipped airplane and it veered off the right side of the 
runway, despite the pilot's attempt to correct back to the left with left rudder and braking. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the tailwheel did not turn to the left properly; 
however, it could not be determined if the anomaly existed before the accident or if it resulted from the 
accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of directional control during landing for reasons that could not be determined based on 
available evidence.
