Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while on final approach, he noticed a vehicle 
stopped short of the runway on a road that intersected the runway. After touchdown, while taxiing and 
about 40 ft from the intersection, the vehicle slowly drove on the runway. The pilot veered the airplane 
left to avoid the vehicle, and the airplane exited the runway to the left. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and firewall. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot added that he assumed that the driver could see the landing airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A vehicle's incursion onto an active runway, which resulted in an evasive action by the pilot landing an 
airplane on that runway and a subsequent runway excursion.
