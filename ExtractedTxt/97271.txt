Registration:
N66786
Aircraft:
Cessna 150M
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that after conducting a touch-and-go landing, the airplane's 
engine experienced a partial loss of power near the end of the runway. The airplane was 
unable to gain altitude, so he landed in an open field. During the forced landing, the airplane's 
engine mount was bent. According to the pilot, the airplane's carburetor was full of carbon and 
that the exhaust pipe was black from carbon buildup. Although it is unlikely that&nbsp;the 
black material in the carburetor was carbon, the excessive buildup within the carburetor would 
have adversely&nbsp;affected the engine's performance.&nbsp;The pilot stated that the 
carburetor was unable to properly regulate the fuel/air mixture due to the&nbsp;excessive 
buildup, corrosion in and on the main nozzle, and basic wear and tear, which caused the engine 
to flood and experience a partial loss of engine power. A review of the airplane's maintenance 
logbook showed that the carburetor had not been rebuilt since it was installed in 1974, about 
44 years before the accident. Thus, it is likely that inadequate service and repair of the 
airplane's carburetor led to partial loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The inadequate service and repair of the airplane's carburetor, which led to a partial loss of 
engine power during takeoff and resulted in a forced landing.
