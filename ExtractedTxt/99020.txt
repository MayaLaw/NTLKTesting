Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while taxiing to the runway for takeoff with the yoke "left and push[ed] in," a 
wind gust from the right lifted the right wing. The pilot was unable to maintain control and the wind 
continued to push the airplane to the left off the runway. The airplane subsequently nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The airport's automated surface observation system reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 030Â° at 20 knots, gusting to 29 knots. The pilot was turning the airplane right onto 
runway 34. Based on this information, the calculated crosswind component while taxiing into takeoff 
position was about 19 knots. The airplane manufacturer reported that the maximum demonstrated 
crosswind component was 15 knots. 
The Federal Aviation Administration's Airplane Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3B, "Taxiing" stated, 
in part, the following:
When taxiing with a quartering headwind, the wing on the upwind side (the side that the wind is coming 
from) tends to be lifted by the wind unless the aileron control is held in that direction (upwind aileron 
UP). Moving the aileron into the UP position reduces the effect of the wind striking that wing, thus 
reducing the lifting action. This control movement also causes the downwind aileron to be placed in the 
DOWN position, thus a small amount of lift and drag on the downwind wing, further reducing the 
tendency of the upwind wing to rise.
