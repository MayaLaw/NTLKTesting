Location:
Zanesville, Ohio
Accident Number:
CEN18LA284
Date & Time:
July 19, 2018, 16:00 Local 
Registration:
N23JH
Aircraft:
Toomey Quickie
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot departed in the experimental, amateur-built airplane for a local photography flight. 
During the return flight, the engine power dropped more than 1,000 rpm, and the engine monitor 
indicated about twice the normal fuel flow. The pilot was initially able to maintain airspeed and altitude; 
however, the rpm subsequently began to decrease further, and the pilot determined that the airplane 
would not be able to reach the airport. During the subsequent forced landing in a cornfield, the airplane's 
nose struck the ground, and the airplane then nosed over.
Examination of the wreckage revealed a separation of the right exhaust manifold, which was directly 
beneath the intake breather for the engine. Additionally, a mixture set screw on the carburetor was found 
loose and extended out, both of which would have resulted in a loss of rpm. Although the weather 
conditions were conducive to carburetor icing at descent power, the failed exhaust manifold and loose 
mixture screw likely led to the loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the exhaust manifold and a loose mixture screw, which resulted in a partial loss of engine 
power.
