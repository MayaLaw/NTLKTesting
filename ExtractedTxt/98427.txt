Analysis 
The pilot reported that, following his first solo flight in the recently acquired airplane, during landing, 
the airplane crossed the runway threshold about 70 knots airspeed with full flaps, and he placed the 
throttle in the idle position. During the landing flare, the airplane sank abruptly and touched down hard. 
The airplane bounced and exited the left side of the runway. The pilot attempted to go around, but the 
airplane descended and impacted the grass safety area on the left side of the runway. The nose landing 
gear separated from the airplane. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right fuselage formers.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.

excursion.
