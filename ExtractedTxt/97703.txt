Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, after completing a touch-and-go landing without incident, during the 
takeoff, the airplane drifted left off the runway toward a wooded area. He attempted to slow and stop the 
airplane, but it struck a culvert, which "launched" the airplane back into the air. He then increased the 
engine power to full, pitched the nose up, flew the airplane back into the traffic pattern, and landed 
without further incident.  
After taking time to gather himself, the student took off again, this time to conduct a basic navigation 
exercise in the local area, but he became disoriented and used the airplane's GPS to return to the 
departure airport. The student stated that he was distracted during the downwind leg due to the previous 
runway excursion and the navigation issues he experienced during the accident flight and allowed the 
airspeed to decrease, which resulted in the airplane stalling. While making the turn to base, the student 
overcorrected with left rudder, which resulted in the airplane entering a spin and subsequently colliding 
with trees.   
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
