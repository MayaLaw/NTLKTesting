Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Lakeview, Arkansas
Accident Number:
CEN18LA274
Date & Time:
July 11, 2018, 20:30 Local 
Registration:
N50183
Aircraft:
Cessna 150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The student pilot reported that after takeoff from the grass airstrip, the left wing impacted a tree branch. 
He overcorrected from the impact and stalled the airplane. The airplane impacted a grass clearing and 
came to rest inverted near trees, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage, both wings, and 
the empennage. 
Although his blood alcohol level was not tested after the accident, the student pilot stated that he drank 
alcohol during the afternoon of the flight. In addition, he admitted to taking baclofen and bupropion, 
which are both potentially impairing medications that carry specific warnings about increased impairing 
effects when used in combination with alcohol.
It is likely the pilot was impaired by his use of a combination of alcohol, baclofen, and bupropion and 
that these effects likely increased his willingness to fly while impaired and prevented him from safely 
taking off. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's impairment by alcohol and multiple medications, which led to his failure to maintain 
obstacle clearance during takeoff and the subsequent exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, 
which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with terrain.
