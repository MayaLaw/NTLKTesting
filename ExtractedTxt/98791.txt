Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a personal cross-country flight. He reported that, upon landing the 
airplane on a turf runway, the airplane began to pull right. He applied left rudder to try to keep the 
airplane going straight. As the airplane continued to pull right, the pilot applied full left rudder and full 
aft elevator and tried applying the left brake. The empennage rose up, so he stopped using the left brake 
and just used the left rudder. Subsequently, the airplane nosed over, which resulted in substantial 
damage to the airplane. The pilot stated that the right brake was locked during the landing. The brake 
was subsequently unlocked to facilitate moving the airplane from the runway.
An examination of the turf runway revealed surface witness marks consistent with a locked right brake. 
However, during examination of the airplane, no anomalies were found that would have caused the right 
brake to lock; therefore, the reason the right brake was locked upon landing could not be determined. 
Given the available evidence, the airplane likely nosed over during the landing roll as the pilot attempted 
to compensate for the locked right brake.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The right brake being locked during the landing roll on the turf runway for reasons that could not be 
determined during postaccident examinations, which resulted in a noseover.
