Registration:
N6215P
Aircraft:
THRUSH AIRCRAFT INC S2R-H80
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that, during the takeoff roll for the agricultural application flight, the right rudder 
pedal went full forward against the material hopper and that he subsequently could not maintain directional 
control of the airplane. The airplane subsequently exited the left side of the runway and struck a ditch. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the right rudder pedal had become detached from the rudder pedal 
adjustment mechanism due to wear on the adjustment track. The Before Starting Engine checklist  included a 
step to adjust and lock the rudder pedals before starting the engine; however, the condition of the rudder 
system indicated that the airplane had been operated with the rudder pedal forward of the final detent position 
and against the safety stop rather than in a locked detent position for an undetermined amount of time. The 
improper adjustment and locking of the rudder pedal adjustment mechanism over time likely led to the 
excessive wear on the rudder pedal adjustment track, the detachment of the rudder pedal, and the pilot’s 
subsequent inability to maintain directional control. After the accident, the airplane manufacturer released a 
service letter detailing the proper use, rigging, and maintenance of the rudder system, including the rudder 
pedal adjustment mechanism.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The improper operation of the rudder pedal adjustment mechanism for an undetermined period of time, which 
led to the failure of the rudder pedal adjustment track, the detachment of the rudder pedal, and the pilot’s 
subsequent inability to maintain directional control.
