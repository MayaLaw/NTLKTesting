Analysis 
The pilot of the turbine-powered airplane reported that, during takeoff for an agricultural application 
flight, he failed to move the power lever from the ground idle position to the flight position. During 
takeoff, the airplane did not attain sufficient airspeed, aerodynamically stalled about 50 ft above the 
ground, impacted terrain, and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, both wings, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to move the power lever to the proper position before takeoff, which resulted in 
insufficient airspeed and a subsequent aerodynamic stall.
