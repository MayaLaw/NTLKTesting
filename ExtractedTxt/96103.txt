Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a cross-country, personal flight. He reported that, while approaching 
the destination airport at a cruise altitude of 2,500 ft mean sea level, he noticed smoke coming from the 
engine cowling. Concerned that there was a fire, he decided to immediately land the airplane in an open 
field. During touchdown, the airplane impacted 5-ft-tall grass and immediately cartwheeled.
 
Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that there was a loose oil line fitting at the oil cooler 
and that oil was dripping on the exhaust system, which likely resulted in the smoke the pilot saw before 
initiating the precautionary landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loose oil line that allowed oil to drip on the exhaust system, which resulted in smoke during 
cruise flight and a subsequent precautionary landing.
