Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, following his first solo flight in the traffic pattern, the airplane's nose was 
pointed left of the runway centerline during touchdown, and the airplane bounced. The student further 
reported that the flight school has a "bounce and go" policy, so he applied full throttle and aborted the 
landing. The airplane continued to the left, the nose landing gear collided with a snow berm on the left 
side of the runway, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the aborted landing, which resulted in a 
collision with a snow berm and a subsequent nose-over.
