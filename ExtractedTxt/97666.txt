Air Tractor AT502
Aircraft Damage:

Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he noticed degraded engine performance when the airplane was about halfway 
down the runway during takeoff for the aerial application flight. Specifically, the engine torque 
decreased from 1,700 ft-lbs at the start of the takeoff to 1,500 ft-lbs. He determined that there was not 
enough runway to abort the takeoff and stop the airplane, so he applied full power and dumped the 
product load. The engine continued to lose power, and the airplane subsequently continued off the end 
of the runway and nosed over in high vegetation. Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine, 
including individual testing of several engine components, confirmed that the engine was producing 
power during the impact sequence, but no determination could be made as to how much power the 
engine produced. The examination did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
evidence.
