Analysis 
Southwest Airlines (SWA) flight 278 was en route to Bob Hope Airport (BUR), Burbank, 
California, when it overran the end of runway 8. The airplane came to rest about 144 ft past the 
departure end of runway and 71 ft into an engineered materials arresting system. Shortly 
before the airplane touched down on the runway, the tower controller informed the flight crew 
that heavy precipitation was occurring directly over the airport and that the wind was from 
270° at 11 knots. BUR runway 8, which was 5,802 ft in length, was one of the shortest runways 
at airports where SWA operated.   
Incident Sequence
Before the airplane reached the top of descent (about 0839), the flight crew requested and 
received a landing data report generated from the SWA performance weight and balance 
(PWB) system. The report indicated that maximum autobrakes should be used for landing on 
runway 8 and that the stopping margin—that is, the difference between the calculated landing 
distance (including a 15% safety factor) and the runway length available—would be 245 ft. The 
PWB system calculations assumed that touchdown would occur 1,500 ft from the runway 
threshold and that the wind would be from about 280° at 5 knots (the wind direction and 
speed at the time of the airport’s 0753 weather observation converted from true north to 
magnetic north). Both flight crewmembers expressed concern about the stopping distance 
given the wet runway, the tailwind that would be present, and the runway length, and they 
discussed that the braking action upon touchdown would need to be “pretty abrupt.” Also, even 
though the first officer stated, during a postincident interview, that BUR “always has a low 
number” for the stopping margin, the captain stated that he had not previously seen a stopping 
margin as low as the one for the incident flight.
While the airplane was descending through the terminal area, the controller advised the flight 
crew that the pilot of a King Air airplane reported a 15-knot loss of airspeed on final approach
