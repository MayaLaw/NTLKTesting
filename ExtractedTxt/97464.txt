Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the pilot, during his first attempt to land, the nosewheel touched down first, and the 
airplane "porpoised." He aborted the landing and accomplished another landing, but when the airplane 
touched down on the runway, the nose landing gear collapsed. The pilot used differential braking to 
steer the airplane into the grassy area on the left side of the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount. 
The pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented if the airspeed had been slower and if the 
airplane's pitch attitude was better than the initial landing. Additionally, the pilot noted that he landed 
with a 90° crosswind from the left.
The pilot reported that, at the time of the accident, the wind was from 08° at 11 knots. The pilot landed 
the airplane on runway 17.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper pitch during the first landing, which resulted in a porpoise, and the failure of the 
nose landing gear during the second landing after a subsequent go-around.
