Analysis 
The commercial pilot was conducting an agricultural application flight. He stated that he felt a loss of 
engine power when he pulled up during a second pass over a field. He pushed the throttle and mixture 
controls forward, but the engine power did not increase. He dumped the payload and then located a 
landing area. The pilot flew the airplane at its best glide speed, and the airplane struck a tree short of the 
landing area. Subsequently, the airplane spun right. He pulled the control stick back and applied right 
rudder to maintain the airplane in an upright attitude before it impacted the ground and erupted into a 
postimpact fire. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the two propeller blades were relatively straight, 
consistent with a lack of torsion, indicating that the engine lost all power before impact. Postimpact fire 
destroyed the engine, engine accessories, and airframe, which precluded functional testing of any 
components. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.
