Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, the tailwheel-equipped airplane veered left and began to 
bounce. He applied right rudder correction, which quickly turned the airplane right toward the 
centerline, and he then applied left rudder to realign with the runway heading. He increased the engine 
power setting to full to perform a go-around, but the airplane, during its third bounce, ground looped to 
the left. The right wing impacted the ground, and the airplane came to rest on its right side with the wing 
at a 90Â° angle.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the automated weather observation system located on the airport reported that, 
about 15 minutes before the accident, the wind was light and variable at 2 knots, gusting to 5 knots. The 
airplane landed on runway 28.
