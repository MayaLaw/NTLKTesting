Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing roll, the tail "lifted back 
up" due to a "wind gust" and that the airplane then veered left, spun, exited the runway, and the right 
wing impacted muddy terrain. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported the wind was light and variable at 5 knots.
An automated weather observation station located about 15 nautical miles from the accident site 
reported that, about 30 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 150° at 4 knots and that, about 30 
minutes after the accident, the wind was from 120° at 5 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 
30.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing in variable wind conditions, which 
resulted in the right wing impacting muddy terrain.
