Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while performing a high-speed taxi to evaluate an erratic airspeed indicator, the 
airplane began to porpoise, so she performed a takeoff and maneuvered the airplane around the traffic 
pattern to land. The pilot was distracted by other airplanes in the traffic pattern and did not perform the 
landing checklist and felt "behind" the airplane. On final approach, she pushed in the throttle control to 
correct for a rapid descent rate; however, the engine did not respond, and the airplane landed hard in 
gravel short of the intended runway. The pilot added that, after the impact, she noted that the mixture 
control was fully out and that she may have pulled out the wrong engine control during the approach. A 
witness on the ground reported that the airplane descended rapidly in a flat attitude with the propeller 
rotating slowly. The witness responded to the accident scene and noted that the mixture, throttle, and 
propeller controls were all pulled out and that the pilot could not explain how that happened, but she did 
state that she was very distracted while flying in the pattern. The pilot stated that she had not flown for 
about 8 months and had no intent to fly that day. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the 
fuselage. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's mismanagement of the engine controls due to distraction in the traffic pattern, which resulted 
in a hard landing short of the runway.
