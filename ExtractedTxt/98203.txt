Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he was conducting a public aerial observation 
flight. During takeoff from an off-airport gravel airstrip, the airplane became airborne quickly. He added 
that the airplane settled back on the airstrip in a tail-low attitude, but he continued the takeoff. He "did 
not feel or hear any objects strike or damage the aircraft," and due to adverse weather conditions, he 
continued the flight to an alternate airport without further incident instead of continuing the observation 
flight.
Postaccident examination revealed leading edge damage and a hole in the left horizontal stabilizer. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's premature liftoff and subsequent settling of the airplane to the gravel airstrip.
