Analysis 
The student pilot and passenger were departing on a personal flight in the student pilot's airplane. 
Witnesses saw the airplane climb to about 200 ft above the runway at a slow airspeed, stall, and descend 
in a right turn until impact with terrain. According to the pilot's wife, he regularly flew the airplane, 
often with passengers. No pilot logbooks or records were found and the student's flight experience could 
not be determined. Examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that 
would have precluded normal operation. Given the atmospheric conditions, the density altitude about the 
time of the accident was 6,660 ft mean sea level (msl).
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An inadvertent stall, resulting in an uncontrollable descent and impact with terrain. Contributing to the 
accident was the high density altitude.
