Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, on short final, the airplane was too low, too slow, and right of the runway 
centerline, and that he overcorrected to clear trees located at the approach end of runway 12. 
Subsequently, the airplane stalled and touched down on the upsloping approach end of the runway. The 
right wing struck rising terrain in the safety area on the right side of the runway, and the airplane 
skidded across the grass safety area and came to rest on the parallel taxiway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the engine mounts. 
The runway had rising terrain at both the approach and departure ends. The airport facility directory 
noted that runway 12 had 20-ft-tall trees 25 ft from the runway threshold and required a 4:1 glideslope to 
remain clear of them. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain the proper glidepath and his subsequent abrupt maneuver to avoid trees, 
which led to the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and resulted in an aerodynamic stall 
during landing and a subsequent loss of directional control.
