Analysis 
The pilot departed on a cross-country flight with the fuel selectors set to the main fuel tanks. Upon 
reaching a cruise altitude of 6,000 ft, the left engine lost total power. The pilot tried to restart the engine 
but was unsuccessful. Shortly thereafter, the right engine lost total power. The pilot reported that he did 
not use the emergency checklist or switch the fuel selector to another tank, as he was too busy trying to 
restart the engines. The pilot conducted a forced landing to a field, during which the airplane impacted 
an irrigation ditch, resulting in substantial damage.
The fuel selector was found set to the main fuel tanks, which were devoid of fuel. However, measurable 
fuel was found in the remaining two auxiliary tanks. Examination of the engine and fuel 
system revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have 
precluded normal operation. 
Given the available evidence, it is likely that the loss of engine power was due to the pilot's 
mismanagement of the available fuel, which resulted in fuel starvation. It is also likely that, had the pilot 
completed the emergency checklist for a loss of engine power/engine restart, fuel flow and engine power 
would have been restored.
