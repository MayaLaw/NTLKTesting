Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while en route, the air was "unstable and choppy," and the airplane did not climb 
as expected. He added that the airplane "managed to climb to 9,500 [ft mean sea level] and maintain the 
altitude" but then had a "sudden and violent drop in altitude followed by a down draft." Subsequently, 
the airplane descended to 500 ft above the ground and was between two hills and still "struggling to 
climb." He observed what appeared to be a dirt plateau followed by a cliff and decided to land on the 
plateau to "avoid possibly falling off the cliff." During the landing, the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to continue flight in mountainous terrain with downdraft conditions, which 
necessitated a precautionary landing on unsuitable terrain.
