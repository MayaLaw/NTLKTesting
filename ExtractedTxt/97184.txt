Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a flight review, while landing in gusting wind conditions, the airplane 
ballooned and landed hard on the left main landing gear. The airplane veered sharply to the left, and the 
pilot applied full power to go around, but the airplane "would not climb." The flight instructor took the 
flight controls and the airplane came to rest about 400 yards south of the runway.
The flight instructor reported that, during the landing, the airplane ballooned and "abruptly dropped" 
onto the runway, damaging the left landing gear. The airplane veered to the left, the pilot applied power 
to go around, and the airplane bounced into the air. He added that the airplane would not climb and 
continued to bounce multiple times before coming to rest south of the runway. He believed the propeller 
and landing gear damage may have prevented the airplane from climbing during the go around.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 6 minutes before 
the accident, the wind was from 250Â° at 11 knots, gusting to 16 knots. The airplane landed on runway 
27.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare during gusting wind conditions, and the flight instructor's delayed 
remedial action.
