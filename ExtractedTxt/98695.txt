Part 91: General aviation - Aerial observation
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, before the flight, he was rushed and did not follow the preflight checklist. During 
the takeoff with the airplane its near maximum gross weight, he noticed that it was accelerating slowly 
but that the airspeed was sufficient. He applied elevator back pressure to rotate, but he immediately 
noticed that the control lock was still in place on the yoke, and he attempted to remove it to no avail. He 
added that he did not recall trying to abort the takeoff or reduce power. The airplane overran the end of 
the runway, impacted water, and inverted before sinking.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to remove the gust lock before flight, which resulted in the airplane's inability to rotate 
and a subsequent runway overrun. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to follow the 
preflight checklist.
