Analysis 
The pilot of the airplane reported that, during touchdown on a paved runway, the airplane encountered a 
wind gust and then became airborne. The pilot added full power to go around, but the left wing 
aerodynamically stalled, and the left float struck the runway, which resulted in a cartwheel.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station, located 11 miles west of the accident airport, reported that, 
about the time of the accident, the wind was from 040Â° at 7 knots. The airplane landed on runway 8.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during a go-around.
