Analysis 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Safety Inspector that responded to the accident 
site reported that the pilot of the experimental, amateur built, tailwheel landing gear-equipped bi-plane 
reported to the inspector, that during the takeoff roll the bi-plane drifted off the left side of the turf and 
gravel runway. The pilot reported that after he had completed his engine run-up and all indications were 
normal, he lightly applied power and began his takeoff roll from a concrete pad at the approach end of 
the runway. He reported to the inspector that the bi-plane began to drift to the left and he did not feel as 
though he had rudder authority, so he added more power with the intent to increase the airflow over the 
rudder, but the torque from the added power exacerbated the loss of control. The bi-plane drifted further 
left, exited the runway, and struck a post that supported a satellite dish and subsequently struck a tree. 
The bi-plane sustained substantial damage to the four wings and the fuselage. The pilot reported to the 
inspector that in hindsight it would have been better to abort the takeoff.
The FAA Inspector reported that during the airplane examination he did not find any evidence of aircraft 
system or component failure prior to the impact. 
The NTSB Investigator-in-charge attempted to contact the pilot on multiple occasions to no avail. The 
pilot did not submit the NTSB Form 6120.1.
