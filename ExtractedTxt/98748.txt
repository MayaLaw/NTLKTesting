Analysis 
The solo student pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during final approach to land, he 
realized the airplane was too high, so he performed a forward slip. During touchdown, the airplane 
bounced twice and veered right. The airplane ground looped to the right, exited the runway, and the right 
main landing gear struck a guard rail. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing lift strut.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
