Analysis 
About 5 minutes after taking off, the pilot observed that the left upper aileron had come 
loose from the inboard hinge. The pilot returned to the departure airport and landed 
uneventfully. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that a wing rib aft of 
the spar at the outboard aileron cutout was substantially damaged.  
Examination of the aileron hinge strap fracture surfaces revealed crack arrest marks and 
thumbnail-shaped patterns on the fracture surfaces, which emanated from both the top 
and bottom surfaces of the hinge strap. The fracture surfaces were consistent with 
asymmetric reverse-bending fatigue crack propagation. 
The fatigue cracking propagated from the top and bottom surfaces through almost the 
entire cross-section of the hinge strap.
The pilot reported that while there were no inspection criteria from the manufacturer 
relative to the hinge straps, all hinge straps were inspected as part of each annual 
inspection.
