Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, he flared too high, and the airplane aerodynamically stalled. He 
added that the airplane landed hard, the nose landing gear collapsed, the airplane veered right off the 
runway into the dirt, and it then nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during the landing flare, which resulted in 
an aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Angle of attack - Capability exceeded
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot
