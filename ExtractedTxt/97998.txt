Analysis 
The private pilot was on a personal cross-country flight and had maneuvered the airplane onto the base 
leg of the traffic pattern for his destination airport. He stated that the airplane likely encountered a 
downdraft and experienced a loss of lift. Despite his attempts to arrest the descent by adding full throttle, 
the airplane impacted terrain short of the runway. The pilot thought that the accident may have been 
prevented if he had configured the airplane to land in a steeper and higher approach, combined with 
more airspeed. He reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control after encountering a downdraft on approach to the 
runway.
Findings
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot
Environmental issues
Downdraft - Effect on operation
