Analysis 
The pilot and pilot-rated passenger were completing the second leg of a multileg flight. Flight data 
indicated that the final approach was below the glideslope for the runway and the airplane’s airspeed 
was above the stall limit. During the approach, the airplane impacted a tall tree about 1,500 ft from the 
runway threshold, the roof of a house, and a second tree before coming to rest in a taxi area between 
houses. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Although the pilot should have been familiar with the runway characteristics given that he had a hangar 
near the airpark and had flown into the airpark before, it is likely that the upsloping runway and paved 
surfaces before the displaced threshold gave the pilot the visual illusion that the airplane was at a higher 
altitude than it actually was and that the pilot thus flew a lower approach. Although a visual approach 
path indicator was positioned left of the runway threshold, the pilot likely did not monitor the indicator 
during the final approach.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to monitor the airport’s visual approach path indicator during the final approach to the 
upsloping runway, which resulted in a low approach path and impact with terrain.
