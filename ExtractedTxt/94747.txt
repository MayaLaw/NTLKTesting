Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that he had not flown for 45 days before the accident due to inclement 
weather. He added that, during the touch-and-go takeoff roll, the airplane drifted to the left. He further 
added that he attempted to correct for the drift by using the control yoke instead of the rudder. 
Subsequently, the airplane impacted a snow bank on the south side of the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and empennage. 
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's inadvertent use of the control yoke to correct for a drift and his subsequent failure to 
maintain directional control during takeoff.
