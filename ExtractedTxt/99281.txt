Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, on his second approach, he encountered "bumpy" air, and the airplane 
ballooned. He corrected by adding power, leveling the wings, and continuing the landing. Just before 
touchdown, the right wing lifted, and the airplane drifted left of the runway centerline. He applied power 
to go around, but the stall warning activated, and the airplane continued to drift left. Subsequently, the 
airplane aerodynamically stalled and collided with the ground and an airport taxiway sign. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage. 
The student reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
About the time of the accident, the airport's automated weather reporting station reported that the wind 
was from 270Â° at 6 knots. The pilot was landing the airplane on runway 23.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain lateral control during landing and his exceedance of the airplane's critical 
angle of attack during the subsequent aborted landing, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
