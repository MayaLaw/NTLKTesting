Analysis 
According to the pilot, he was on his sixth agricultural application pass of the third field for the day. He 
reported that, during that pass, the airplane's tail struck "unseen powerlines." He recalled that the power 
lines crossed the field at an angle and that the power line poles were hidden by trees on both sides of the 
field. The pilot flew to a nearby airport and landed without further incident. The vertical stabilizer and 
the rudder sustained substantial damage.
Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137.19 (e) states, in part,
Knowledge and skill tests. The applicant must show, or have the person who is designated as the chief 
supervisor of agricultural aircraft operations for him show, that he has satisfactory knowledge and skill 
regarding agricultural aircraft operations, as described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(1)(i) Steps to be taken before starting operations, including survey of the area to be worked. â€¦
(1)(vi) Safe flight and application procedures.
During an interview with the operator, the investigator-in-charge (IIC) asked if documented training was 
provided to pilots regarding the location of wire hazards for the area of operation, and the operator 
responded that it did not provide this information to its pilots. At the request of the IIC, the operator 
agreed to provide documented, local area power line and obstacle avoidance training to pilots who 
perform application operations. The operator has completed the recommended training.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies with the airframe or engine that 
would have prevented normal operation.
