Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while en route, he noticed a loose camlock screw on the engine cowling and 
decided to land the airplane at the nearest airport. He added that, during the landing, he applied the 
brakes, but they had "minimal effect." As the airplane slowed "very slightly," he determined he could 
make the taxiway turn. But, he added that, "the left steering did not [a]ffect direction." The airplane 
exited the runway and went over the runway embankment.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that the brakes failed to slow the airplane to a complete stop, and the nosewheel failed 
to turn.
A local mechanic examined the brakes following the accident and found no anomalies. 
The airport manager reported that marks on the runway showed that the airplane had touched down 
about 1,000 to 1,500 ft beyond the approach end of the runway. Additionally, there was about a 15- ft-
long skid mark showing a skidding left turn before the airplane exited the runway. 
Pictures submitted by the Federal Aviation Administration inspector showed the skid marks turning left 
while exiting the end of the runway. 
The airport supplement stated that runway 25 sloped downhill to the west.
