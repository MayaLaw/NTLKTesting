Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, he attempted a three-point landing with 48째 of 
flaps applied in a strong, left crosswind. He reported that, after landing, the airplane lifted off again, and 
the left wing lifted. The pilot applied aileron and rudder inputs to counter the left crosswind, but the 
inputs were ineffective due to the airplane's low airspeed. He applied power to fly out of the gusting left 
crosswind condition, but the airplane veered right, the right wing struck the ground, and the airplane 
cartwheeled.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mounts, both wings, and the aft fuselage. 
The METAR at the accident airport reported, about the time of the accident, wind from 160째 at 12 knots, 
gusting to 25 knots. The highest wind reported during the observation period was from 190째 at 31 knots. 
The pilot landed the airplane on runway 19.
According to the manufacturer's airplane flight manual, the maximum demonstrated crosswind 
component was 12 knots, and the flap extension should be limited to 0째. The pilot reported that the 
accident could have been prevented if he had attempted a wheel landing with less than full flaps.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
