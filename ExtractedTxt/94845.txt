Analysis 
The pilot on the controls reported that, during landing while about 70 knots, the airplane buffeted and 
was pushed to the right of the runway centerline. The pilot recovered and realigned the airplane with the 
nose on the centerline. He reported that, when he entered the flare, the airplane encountered another 
wind gust, and the airplane ballooned. The airplane descended and pitched down and landed hard on the 
nose gear. The propeller struck the ground, and the pilot landed the airplane without further incident. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall. 
The METAR reported that the wind was variable at 05 knots about the time of the accident.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain pitch control, which resulted in a hard landing.
