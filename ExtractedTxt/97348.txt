Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during an agricultural application flight, he observed a power transmission wire 
with no obstructions underneath. He added that he turned around to enter the spray field under the wire, 
where he observed one wire sagging lower than the other wires. While flying under the power 
transmission wire, the airplane encountered turbulence, so he decided to lower the nose to prevent being 
pushed into the wire. However, the tail rose up and struck the power transmission wire.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and rudder.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind was calm.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate clearance from a power transmission wire.
