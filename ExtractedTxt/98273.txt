Analysis 
A flight instructor and a private pilot receiving instruction departed on a night training flight. The pilot 
had recently obtained her private pilot certificate without night training time under a regulatory 
exception for Alaska pilots. The accident flight was her first night flight. After performing one night 
landing and takeoff at the accident airport, the pilot receiving instruction performed a right turn to the 
crosswind leg at pattern altitude. The instructor, who was in the right seat, then exclaimed "what is up 
with your attitude?" The instructor took control of the airplane after he realized that the airplane was 
descending and the pilot receiving instruction was disoriented; however, the airplane impacted terrain 
shortly after. Both pilots stated that it was a dark, moonless night with no visible horizon in the vicinity 
of the remote airport. The pilot receiving instruction reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or 
failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot receiving instruction's failure to maintain control during a night landing pattern crosswind turn 
due to spatial disorientation and the flight instructor's inadequate supervision and delayed remedial 
action, which resulted in impact with terrain.
