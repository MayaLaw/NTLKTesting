Analysis 
The runway incursion sequence began when the air traffic control (ATC) local controller (LC) 
cleared (ENY3660) for takeoff from an inactive runway that had been NOTAM’d closed for arrivals to 
accommodate airfield mowing in the underrun. 
Interviews with controllers after the incident revealed SGF runway 14 had been NOTAM’d 
closed by SGF Airport Operations for arrivals but was available for departures. There were mowers in 
the underrun of runway 14 in the runway safety area (RSA) that prohibited an overflight by landing air 
traffic. The NOTAM was published and available to aircrew and air traffic control via the FAA website 
and covered the period from 1230 UTC to 2100 UTC. 
Because runway 14/32 was closed to landing traffic, SGF standard operating procedures 
permitted the transfer of control for the runway to the ground controller (GC) position to use for runway 
crossings without the need for coordination with LC. Because GC now had operational control of the 
runway, the LC was required to request the use of the closed runway from the GC prior to issuing any 
clearances for takeoff. 
The pilot of ENY3660 requested to use runway 14 for a departure, and the GC approved the 
request and issued taxi instructions to runway 14. While the airplane was taxiing to runway 14, VAN7 
requested to cross runway 14 while GC maintained operational control of the runway. Because GC had 
control of the runway, there was no requirement to coordinate the closed runway vehicle crossing with 
LC.
When the pilot of ENY3660 called the LC ready for takeoff from runway 14, the LC issued a takeoff 
clearance without coordinating with GC.
