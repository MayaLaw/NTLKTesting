Analysis 
The pilot reported that after a normal preflight, he proceeded to the runway and started the takeoff roll. 
Once the airplane’s tail lifted off the ground, the airplane pulled toward the left and continued to do so 
despite the pilot adding right rudder. He reduced the power to idle and attempted to stop the airplane; 
however, it exited the runway surface and impacted a tree substantially damaging the wings.  The pilot 
had about 82 hours in make and model but only about 5 to 10 hours in the accident airplane, which had a 
more powerful engine than his previous airplane. Postaccident examination revealed there were no 
anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Wind reports shortly before and after the accident indicate a crosswind in relation to the takeoff runway. 
In addition, the accident airplane’s more powerful engine may have responded differently on takeoff 
than what the pilot was accustomed to.  Despite these potential factors, the pilot ultimately did not 
maintain directional control during takeoff.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to maintain directional control during takeoff with a crosswind.
