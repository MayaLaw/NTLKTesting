Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during an uphill takeoff into ascending terrain, about 4,000 ft down the 6,000-ft-
long runway and at 80 knots, he rotated the airplane and stayed in ground effect to gain airspeed. He 
began pulling back to establish a climb, but the stall warning horn sounded, so he reduced the pitch 
attitude. He added that he "constantly attempted" to pitch up until he heard the stall horn. At the end of 
the runway, he retracted the landing gear, but it did not affect the airplane’s performance. He reported 
that he knew the airplane had attained a positive climb rate but did not know the specific value. He then 
saw that the airplane was going to strike a tree, so he pulled back hard, but the airplane struck the tree 
and then impacted terrain.
 The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport’s automated weather observation station reported that, about 9 minutes after the accident, the 
wind was calm, temperature 50°F, dew point 3°F, and an altimeter setting of 30.41 inches of mercury. 
The airplane departed from runway 18.
The airport elevation was about 6,691 ft mean sea level (msl). Runway 18 was 6,000 ft by 100 ft with a 
1.0% up gradient. The calculated density altitude was 7,128 ft. The calculated takeoff distance with flaps 
up was 2,442 ft, and the takeoff distance over a 50-ft obstacle was 4,440 ft. The calculated climb rate 
was 670 ft per minute.
The airplane was equipped with additional tip tanks per a supplemental type certificate, which increased 
the allowable maximum gross weight to 3,833 lbs. The pilot reported that the airplane’s weight at the 
time of the accident was 3,797 lbs with a center of gravity of 80.7 inches, which was near the forward 
center of gravity limit.
