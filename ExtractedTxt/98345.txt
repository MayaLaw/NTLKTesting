Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing at an off-airport dirt and 
grass landing area, the ground was very slippery. During the landing roll, the airplane struck a few holes 
and bumps, and the airplane rocked side to side. The airplane's left wing struck the ground and "pushed 
up," which caused the right wing to strike and catch the ground. The airplane ground looped to the right 
and came to rest in a nose-down attitude.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of an unsuitable off-airport landing area, which resulted in a ground loop.
