Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing flare on runway 16L, he felt a wind gust from the right. To 
counter the gust, he applied left rudder and right aileron to lower the right wing. When the nose landing 
gear touched down on the runway, the airplane veered left, and he applied "minimal right steering and 
braking" to avoid overcorrecting and colliding with an airplane that was landing on runway 16R. 
Subsequently, the airplane exited the left side of the runway and struck a taxiway sign before it came to 
a stop. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The airport's METAR reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was calm.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing.
