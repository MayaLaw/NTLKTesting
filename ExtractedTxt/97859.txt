Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Lincolnton, North Carolina
Accident Number:
ERA18FA197
Date & Time:
July 24, 2018, 05:21 Local 
Registration:
N38523
Aircraft:
Piper PA32R
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
VFR encounter with IMC
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The noninstrument-rated private pilot and one passenger departed on a personal cross-country visual 
flight rules flight in dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) that included 1 1/2 statute 
miles visibility in mist and an overcast cloud layer 200 ft above ground level. The pilot did not obtain an 
official weather briefing before departing on the flight, and what preflight weather information he may 
have obtained could not be determined. Onboard data indicated that the airplane departed, entered a 
climbing left turn to a downwind leg for the runway, and about 1 minute after takeoff, entered a rapid 
left turning descent that continued to ground contact.Postaccident examination of the airframe and 
engine did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded 
normal operation.
The restricted visibility due to the dark night and instrument conditions was conducive to the 
development of spatial disorientation, and the airplane's flight track was consistent with the known 
effects of spatial disorientation. According to a family member, the pilot stated that he was going to 
attend an air show and had planned to leave early in the morning for "a window of good weather." 
Despite not being instrument rated, the pilot likely chose to depart due to his self-induced pressure to 
complete the flight as planned. It is likely that the pilot's decision to depart into IMC resulted in his 
spatial disorientation and a subsequent loss of airplane control.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The noninstrument-rated pilot's intentional visual flight rules flight into instrument 
meteorological conditions, which resulted in a loss of control due to spatial disorientation. 
Contributing the accident was the pilot's self-induced pressure to complete the flight as 
planned.
