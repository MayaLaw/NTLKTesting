Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he had performed several takeoffs and 
landings from the shoreline of a lake. He reported that, during the takeoff roll about 25 knots, a right 
crosswind gust pushed the airplane left and into the water. The left main landing gear entered the water, 
and the airplane spun 90° to the left, and the airplane nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and rudder.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot reported that, during takeoff, the wind was from 180° at 20 knots, gusting to 45 knots. The 
METAR for an airport located 4 nautical miles from the accident site reported that, about the time of the 
accident, the wind was from 210° at 11 knots with no gusts. The pilot reported that he took off to the 
southeast.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff roll with crosswind conditions.
