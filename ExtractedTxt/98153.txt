Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Swainsboro, Georgia
Accident Number:
ERA18FA231
Date & Time:
August 25, 2018, 14:00 Local 
Registration:
N4785D
Aircraft:
Cessna 182
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
4 Fatal, 1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Skydiving
Analysis 
After completing several skydiving flights without incident, the airplane was refueled. The pilot 
completed the next flight uneventfully; however, during takeoff on the subsequent flight, the airplane 
reached an altitude about 150 ft above ground level when it lost total engine power. A witness reported 
that the wings "rocked" left and right before the airplane pitched down and impacted the ground. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the right fuel tank cap was missing and tape was covering the 
fuel filler port on the right wing. The tape was installed during the most recent refueling. The fuel 
selector valve sustained significant thermal damage and was observed in the "both" position when 
disassembled. Examination of the fuel tank vent line did not reveal any obstructions; however, the line 
was impact damaged. Examination of the engine and its components revealed no anomalies that would 
have precluded normal operation. While the installation of tape over the right wing fuel filler port likely 
resulted in a non-venting seal, it could not be determined if it resulted in the loss of engine power, as 
other means of fuel system venting likely remained. After the total loss of engine power, the airplane 
exceeded its critical angle of attack and experienced an aerodynamic stall at too low of an altitude for 
the pilot to recover.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on available 
information.
