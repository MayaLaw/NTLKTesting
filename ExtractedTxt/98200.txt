Analysis 
The airline transport pilot and his daughter departed in day visual meteorological conditions with the 
morning sun located behind the airplane. About 10 minutes after takeoff, the airplane impacted a 
charted, 1,793-ft-tall television/radio tower about 200 ft below the apex of the tower. 
Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures 
that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot and his wife were in the process of divorce. The 
pilot's wife was very concerned after the pilot and her daughter departed without notice several weeks 
before the accident. The pilot had become unresponsive to phone calls from his work supervisor and had 
been making unauthorized purchases with his work credit card before the accident. On the day before 
the accident, the pilot's attorney informed the pilot that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. 
A direct course from the departure airport to the pilot's home airport was over 5 miles south of the 
tower. Although a surveillance video and witness statements indicated that the tower's lighting was 
erratic, the tower was adequately lit, and the visibility of the tower was not a factor in the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a charted and illuminated television/radio tower.
