Analysis 
According to the pilot in the retractable-landing gear-equipped airplane, he did not extend the landing 
gear before landing. He reported that he became distracted while communicating with other aircraft and 
controlling the airplane in the gusting wind conditions. Further, he did not realize that what he perceived 
as the stall warning horn was actually the landing gear unsafe warning horn. He added that the accident 
could have been prevented by repeating his GUMPFS checklist on final and checking to ensure that the 
three green landing gear safe lights were illuminated.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage bulkheads and spar carry-through.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear before landing. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's 
failure to use the Before Landing checklist due to being distracted while communicating with other 
aircraft and controlling the airplane in the gusting wind conditions.
