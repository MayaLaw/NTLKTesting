Analysis 
The private pilot was attempting to depart from a 2,600-ft-long turf runway with a right quartering 
tailwind with three passengers onboard. A witness estimated that the tailwind was about 8 knots. The 
pilot reported that the only thing he could recall about the flight was that he had "difficulty getting the 
airplane into the air." Another witness reported that, immediately after becoming airborne, the airplane 
entered a series of pitch oscillations; during each oscillation, the airplane appeared to be near the stall 
speed and lose altitude. After several oscillations, the airplane neared the left side of the runway and 
impacted treetops before impacting the ground and cartwheeling. One of the witnesses stated that the 
engine sound did not change during takeoff and that the engine appeared to be running well the entire 
time.
Given the evidence, it is likely that the pilot's failure to attain adequate airspeed before attempting the 
takeoff with a tailwind, which led to the airplane being unable to sustain flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain adequate airspeed before attempting the takeoff with a tailwind, 
which resulted in the airplane being unable to sustain flight.
