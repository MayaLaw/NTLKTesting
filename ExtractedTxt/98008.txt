Analysis 
The private pilot reported that he departed the airport for the local flight with both wing fuel tanks full of 
fuel and the fuel selector on the left tank. After flying for about 1 hour, he landed at the airport and 
departed again. When the airplane was about 500 ft above ground level, the pilot intended to change the 
fuel selector to the right fuel tank. However, he inadvertently switched the fuel selector to the off 
position, and the engine lost power. The pilot immediately switched the fuel selector back to the left fuel 
tank and attempted to restart the engine without success. He executed a forced landing to a field, and, 
during the landing rollout, the airplane collided with a fence and hay bale, which resulted in substantial 
damage. The pilot mismanaged the fuel during flight, which resulted in fuel starvation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate fuel management, which resulted in fuel starvation and a forced landing.
