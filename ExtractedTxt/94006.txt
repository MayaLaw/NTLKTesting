Analysis 
The pilot of the experimental, amateur-built airplane reported that he was demonstrating turns for the 
passenger while flying at a low altitude when he lost control of the airplane and "stalled." The airplane 
collided with trees and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage. The pilot 
reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of 
attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
