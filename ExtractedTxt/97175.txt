Analysis 
On May 7, 2018, at approximately 0010 am eastern daylight time, Southwest Airlines flight 6263, a 
B737-800, N8655D, was struck by a Southwest Airlines maintenance truck as the aircraft was being 
marshaled into its gate at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (KBWI), 
Baltimore, Maryland.  There were no injuries to the 181 passengers and crewmembers onboard and the 
airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 as a regularly
