Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing roll, a wind gust from the 
left caused the left wing to rise. The airplane veered right, and he added full aileron, rudder, and brake to 
recover to no avail. The pilot stated he heard a "loud noise," the airplane veered sharply, and it then 
came to rest on an adjacent taxiway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station at the airport reported that, about 23 minutes before the 
accident, the wind was from 330Â° at 10 knots. The airplane landed on runway 32.
