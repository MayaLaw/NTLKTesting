Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was attempting a wheel landing in the tailwheel-equipped airplane after a cross-country flight. 
He reported that winds were gusty during the long, straight-in approach and that he increased airspeed to 
compensate for the gusts. During the approach to landing, the airplane encountered turbulent air, and a 
gust of wind caused the airplane to balloon about 8-12 ft above the runway. The pilot initiated a go-
around and said he added full power when the engine hesitated and "stuttered." The airplane settled, the 
right wing struck the ground, and the airplane spun before it came to rest. A postimpact fire ensued, 
which consumed most of the cockpit and fuselage. Thermal damage precluded a thorough engine 
examination.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of control while landing a tailwheel-equipped airplane in gusting wind conditions.
Findings
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot
Environmental issues
Gusts - Effect on operation
