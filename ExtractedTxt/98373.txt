Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that during cruise flight, the engine began to run roughly. The No. 3 cylinder 
then separated from the airplane; the engine lost all power, and oil began to cover the windshield. The 
pilot flew via instruments and landed in a marsh; the right wing of the airplane separated after contacting 
a tree. Postaccident engine examination revealed impact marks on the engine crankcase where the No. 3 
cylinder would have been secured. The marks were consistent with the cylinder impacting the case 
multiple times. The examination also revealed that several of the nuts on other cylinders were well 
below the required 50 ft-lbs of torque. The engine's most recent overhaul was completed about 12 years 
before the accident, and the engine had accrued about 366 hours since that overhaul; there was no record 
of cylinder removal or replacement since the engine overhaul. It is likely that undertorqued cylinder nuts 
allowed the cylinder to come loose and separate from the engine. The investigation could not determine 
if the undertorqued condition of the cylinder nuts was the result of an improper overhaul or possible 
improper undocumented maintenance after the overhaul.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power after the separation of the No. 3 cylinder from the crankcase due to 
improper maintenance.
