Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during approach to a backcountry, private dirt airstrip, the wind was swirling, 
and he decided to go around. During the second landing attempt, the airplane descended below the 
treetops surrounding the airstrip, which prevented the pilot's ability to safely perform a go around, and a 
wind gust from behind the airplane pushed it past the end of the runway into trees.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind was variable at 15 knots, gusting to 15 to 20 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate approach in gusting tailwind conditions, which resulted in a 
runway overshoot.
