Analysis 
The commercial pilot was flight testing the airplane to evaluate an experimental diesel engine reduction 
gearbox. During the takeoff, as the airplane climbed above 500 ft above ground level, the pilot increased 
engine power, but a total loss of engine power occurred shortly afterward. The pilot initiated a left 
descending turn to return to the runway. During the landing sequence, the airplane had a high descent 
rate. The airplane touched down hard, resulting in the separation of the left main landing gear axle and 
substantial damage to the left wing lift strut.  
Postaccident examination of the engine reduction gearbox found that two propeller shaft bearings inside 
the reduction gearbox seized, causing the total loss of engine power.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The seizure of two bearings in the reduction gearbox, resulting in the total loss of engine power. 
Contributing to the accident was a high descent rate which resulted in a hard landing.
