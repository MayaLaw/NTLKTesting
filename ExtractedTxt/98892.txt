Analysis 
The commercial pilot was conducting a pipeline patrol flight. He reported that, while he was looking 
down in the cockpit writing down observations about the pipeline, he felt the airplane pull left; the 
airplane had struck a cell tower wire. The pilot stated that he did not see the wire because he was 
looking down. The pilot was able to control the airplane, immediately declared an emergency, and 
landed at an airport about 10 miles north of where the wire strike occurred. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that a 4-ft-long section of the left wing was torn off the airplane, 
just outboard of the left aileron. The pilot stated that many pipeline patrol operations have an observer 
onboard in addition to the pilot, one of whom looks outside the airplane to observe the pipeline while the 
other person writes down the observations. He also stated that he could have waited to write down 
information after passing the tower area. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to see and avoid a cell tower wire during a pipeline patrol flight. Contributing to the 
accident was the pilot's distraction due to writing down observations about the pipeline while flying.
