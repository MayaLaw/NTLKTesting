Registration:
N90LK
Aircraft:
Vans RV 6

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot and flight instructor were conducting a local flight as part of a flight review. Radar data 
showed that the airplane departed and proceeded to a nearby airport, where it entered the traffic pattern. 
The last recorded radar target was located abeam the end of the runway, at an altitude of about 500 ft 
above ground level. There were no known witnesses to the accident sequence.
The airplane came to rest upright, partially submerged within a pond, about 1,000 ft from the approach 
end of the runway. Wreckage and impact signatures from surrounding terrain were consistent with a 
near-vertical impact. Examination revealed no anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Bird remains were found on the right (outboard) arm/clothing of the flight instructor and within the 
engine compartment. The remains were identified as a species common to the accident locale. It is likely 
that a bird strike occurred while the airplane was maneuvering in the traffic pattern for landing, resulting 
in a breach of the canopy/windscreen. Given the lack of mechanical anomalies and the orientation of the 
wreckage, it is likely that the pilots became distracted and exceeded the airplane's critical angle of 
attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall/spin and loss of control.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilots' inadvertent exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack following an inflight collision 
with a bird.
