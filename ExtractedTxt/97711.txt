Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during cruise flight into "wispy clouds," the biplane’s engine started to "run 
rough" then lost all power. About 800 ft above ground level, he restarted the engine, but it quit again. He 
attempted to restart the engine multiple times but was unsuccessful, so he selected a gravel road for 
landing. During the landing, the airplane ground looped into a ditch. The biplane sustained substantial 
damage to the right wing.  
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the biplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located 25 nautical miles away from the accident site 
reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 170° at 5 knots, visibility 7 statute 
miles, clouds broken at 4,800 ft above ground level, temperature 77°F, and dew point 75°F. 
The pilot stated that he did not apply carburetor heat during the accident flight. The atmospheric 
conditions were conducive to serious icing at glide power settings. It is likely that the engine lost power 
due to carburetor icing and the pilot’s failure to apply carburetor heat.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to the pilot's failure to apply carburetor heat in conditions conducive to 
carburetor icing and his subsequent failure to maintain directional control during a forced landing.
