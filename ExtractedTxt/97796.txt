N1822M
Aircraft:
Curtiss Wright C46

Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, following a precautionary shutdown of the No. 2 engine, he diverted to an 
alternate airport that was closer than the original destination. During the landing in tailwind conditions, 
the airplane touched down "a little fast." The pilot added that, as the brakes faded from continuous use, 
the airplane was unable to stop, and it overran the end of the runway, which resulted in substantial 
damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain the proper touchdown speed and his decision to land with a tailwind without 
ensuring that there was adequate runway length for the touchdown.
