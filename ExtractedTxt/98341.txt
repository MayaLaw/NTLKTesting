Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that the airplane bounced and drifted left during the 
three-point landing. He applied right rudder to correct the left drift and aft pressure on the yoke to keep 
the tailwheel on the ground. However, the left wing lifted, and the right main landing gear was 
sideloaded and then collapsed. The right wing struck the ground, and the airplane came to rest on the 
runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
The METAR at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 300Â° at 7 
knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 34.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's loss of directional control during landing.
