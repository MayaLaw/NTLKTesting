Analysis 
The pilot of the amphibious float-equipped airplane reported that during the touchdown to the north on 
choppy lake waters the airplane nosed over. The pilot further reported that when he and the passenger 
egressed from the cockpit and climbed onto the floats he noticed that the wind was 5-7 miles per hour 
(mph) from the south.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe 
or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported as a safety recommendation that the pilot should get a "better read of the wind 
direction" prior to landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The floatplane pilot's improper landing flare during landing on choppy water with a tailwind, which 
resulted in a nose-over. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to determine the wind 
direction before landing.
