Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while en route to the destination airport during the personal flight, the engine lost 
power. The pilot initiated a forced landing to a field, which resulted in substantial damage to the 
airplane. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the engine or 
airframe that would have precluded normal operation. A postaccident examination of the airplane 
revealed that the right fuel tank was empty, while the left fuel tank was full. The pilot stated that he did 
not remember switching fuel tanks during the flight and that, given that the right fuel tank was empty, he 
likely ran out of fuel.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's fuel mismanagement, which led to fuel starvation, a total loss of engine power, and the 
subsequent forced landing to a field.
