Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while departing from a short snow-covered airstrip, the airplane's nose wheel 
lifted off upon arriving at the "go/no go" decision point. He added that, about 30 ft. further the airplane 
encountered deeper snow and the nose landing gear lowered to the ground. Subsequently, he reduced the 
throttle and aborted the takeoff. The airplane exited the airstrip to the left, the right wing encountered 
terrain, and the airplane spun 180Â° and came to rest in a ditch.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the elevator and both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for takeoff, which resulted in a loss of control and runway 
excursion.
