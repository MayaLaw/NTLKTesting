Date & Time:
September 12, 2018, 18:30 Local 
Registration:
N868X
Aircraft:
Aviat A1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, the tailwheel-equipped airplane bounced. The airplane then 
bounced again twice and veered left of the centerline, and he applied "stick back" to pin the tail down. 
He then applied full throttle to go around but did not relieve the back pressure on the stick. 
Subsequently, the airplane pitched up in a "very high" angle of attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic 
stall and spin and subsequent impact with the ground. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during an attempted go-around after the 
airplane bounced, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
