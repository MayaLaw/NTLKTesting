Analysis 
The pilot was approaching the airport to land in instrument meteorological conditions when he 
encountered heavy turbulence. He continued the approach and the airplane started to descend 
rapidly. Although he added full power in an attempt to climb, the airplane continued to 
descend until it collided with the Atlantic Ocean. The forward portion of the fuselage, which 
included the cockpit separated from the airplane. The pilot did not report any anomalies with 
the airplane before the accident. 
Review of weather information for the area of the airport about the time of the accident 
revealed light to moderate precipitation with a high potential for moderate turbulence and low-
level wind shear below about 2,000 ft. Radar imagery did not reveal signatures typically 
associated with microburst activity. Based on the available information, it is likely that the pilot 
encountered low-level windshear and turbulence during the approach, which resulted in a loss 
of airplane control. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An encounter with low-level windshear and turbulence during the landing approach, which 
resulted in a loss of airplane control.
