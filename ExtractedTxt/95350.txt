Registration:
N8578L
Aircraft:
Piper PA25
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Glider tow
Analysis 
The glider tow pilot reported that, during preflight, the fuel indicator read "2/3 full" and he had a "brief 
discussion" with the previous pilot who had just completed numerous glider tow flights without 
refueling. He added that a fuel dipstick was not available, and a visual check of the fuel quantity was not 
completed during preflight. He further added that on the 10th glider tow flight, which was about 2 hours 
of flight time, he noted a "low fuel indication in flight just prior to glider release." Subsequently, the 
glider released and during the return to the airport, about 2 nautical miles from the runway and about 
1,900 above ground, the engine lost power. 
The pilot reported that due to the quartering headwind aloft he did not believe he could make the 
runway, so he attempted to land on an open pasture, but struck trees and impacted terrain about "50 
yards short of [the] pasture."
The fuselage, elevator, and both wings sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to visually check the fuel level prior to takeoff and subsequent mismanagement of the 
available fuel supply during numerous glider tow flights.
