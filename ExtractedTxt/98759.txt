Analysis 
The pilot reported that, about 20 minutes after departure, the airplane began to shudder. He adjusted the 
engine power, but the airplane continued to shake before the engine lost total power.  The pilot 
performed a forced landing to a road, during which the airplane sustained substantial damage. 
Visual examination revealed multiple holes in the top of the engine crankcase. Disassembly of the 
engine revealed that the Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 connecting rods were fractured and separated from the 
connecting rod journals. The connecting rods, connecting rod bearings, and the crankshaftâ€™s connecting 
rod journals displayed thermal discoloration consistent with oil starvation. Examination of the engine 
components and engine-related systems revealed no evidence of a pre-impact oil leak; however, the left 
turbocharger was missing its turbine wheel, and the shaft was fractured outboard of the turbine piston 
ring. A test run of an exemplar engine without the left turbine wheel revealed significant oil loss during 
operation. 
The left turbocharger was overhauled 158 flight hours before the accident, and its wheel assemblies 
were reused rather than replaced, as specified by the manufacturer. It is likely the separation of the left 
turbine wheel resulted in oil escaping the engine, which resulted in oil starvation and catastrophic engine 
failure.
