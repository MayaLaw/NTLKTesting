Analysis 
The pilot of a tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he was doing S-turns while taxiing and that he 
did not see any airplanes in the run-up area. While positioning the airplane in the run-up area, his 
airplane's left wing collided with the propeller of a stopped airplane. 
The pilot of the stopped airplane reported that, after completing a run-up and waiting for a clearance to 
depart, he saw a "warbird" entering the run-up area. The other airplane continued straight, and the left 
wing collided with his airplane's propeller. 
The tailwheel-equipped airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
Both pilots reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with their 
airplanes that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a stopped airplane while taxiing.
