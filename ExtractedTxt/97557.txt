Registration:
N86507
Aircraft:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a cross-country, personal flight. He stated that, while on approach to 
the destination airport, he was unable to extend the landing gear. He declared an emergency and 
attempted to pump the landing gear down via the emergency gear-extension handle to no avail. He then 
observed a large puddle of red hydraulic fluid on the floorboards near the hydraulic pump. The pilot 
realized that he would not be able to extend the gear and conducted a gear-up landing, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the lower fuselage. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the hydraulic reservoir was nearly empty. When 
the emergency handle was activated, a stream of hydraulic fluid sprayed from the surface of the 
aluminum hydraulic line connecting the emergency handle/pump to the electric hydraulic pump that was 
mounted under and behind the pilot's instrument panel. Magnified visual examination of the leaking 
hydraulic line revealed an area of corrosion and pitting on the aluminum surface, which likely resulted 
in a loss of hydraulic pressure and the pilot's inability to extend the landing gear.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An area of pitting and corrosion on the surface of the aluminum hydraulic line connecting the 
emergency handle/pump to the electric hydraulic pump, which resulted in a loss of hydraulic pressure 
and the pilot's inability to extend the landing gear.
