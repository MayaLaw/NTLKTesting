Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the second flight of the day, which was 
a 3 hour 30 minute flight, the tower controller at the destination airport instructed him to land on runway 
35. During the landing roll, he lost directional control, the airplane ground looped to the right, and the 
left wing impacted the ground.
The pilot added that he believed the accident was the result of fatigue. He added that he should have 
requested runway 13, which would have reduced the crosswind component, rather than accept the 
assigned runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and left aileron.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station at the airport reported that, about 37 minutes before the 
accident, the wind was from 100° at 12 knots. The same automated station reported that, about 23 
minutes after the accident, the wind was from 100° at 12 knots, gusting to 22 knots. The airplane landed 
on runway 35.
