Analysis 
The pilot reported that when he arrived in the vicinity of the destination airport, there was fog in the 
valley where the airport was located, and he began circling the airplane at a low engine power setting. 
The engine subsequently lost total power, and the pilot performed a forced landing to a river, resulting in 
substantial damage to the right wing. The atmospheric conditions present in the area at the time of the 
accident were conducive to the development of serious carburetor icing at glide power settings which 
likely resulted in the loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to the development of carburetor icing.
Findings
