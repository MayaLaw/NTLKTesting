Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing roll, the right wing "lifted 
abruptly and rapidly." He attempted to correct with right aileron, but the airplane veered left and then 
began to yaw left. The pilot added right rudder and power to correct to no avail. Subsequently, he 
reduced power, and the airplane exited the runway, impacted a ditch, and then came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and rudder.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot estimated that the wind was from 300° at 24 knots, gusting to 28 knots. The airport's 
automated weather observation station reported that, about 5 minutes before the accident, the wind was 
from 320° at 15 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 31.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in gusting wind conditions.
