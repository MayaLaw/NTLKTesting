Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, during the landing roll with the tailwheel on 
the ground, the airplane may have encountered a wind gust. The airplane exited the runway to the left, 
and the left main landing gear struck a taxiway sign. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left main landing gear attachment points, the lower 
fuselage longeron, and the elevator.
The pilot reported that the wind at the airport about the time of the accident was variable at 4 knots and 
that skies were clear. 
The nearest METAR to the accident site, located 11 miles to the west, reported that, about the time of 
the accident, the wind was from 270Â° at 8 knots with lightning in the distance to the northwest. The pilot 
landed the airplane on runway 35.
The pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented if he had more quickly applied corrective 
actions, including increasing right rudder pedal pressure, using more differential braking, and increasing

The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
