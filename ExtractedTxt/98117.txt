Analysis 
While the airplane was climbing through 3,000 ft mean sea level (msl), the engine began 
running roughly and the fuel flow rate slowed. Shortly after reaching 3,500 ft msl, the engine 
lost total power. The pilot attempted a forced landing at a nearby airport; however, while in a 
spiral descent to land, he misjudged the airplane’s glidepath and landed in grass short of the 
runway. The airplane impacted a drainage ditch, resulting in substantial damage. A detailed 
examination of the engine and components was not conducted and the reason for the loss of 
engine power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s misjudgment of the airplane’s 
glidepath during the forced landing, which resulted in the airplane touching down short of the 
runway.
