Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing, the airplane was "slightly 
fast," touched down "firm" on the runway, and then bounced. He increased the engine power to cushion 
the subsequent landing, but the airplane touched down "left wing low" and pointed right. He then 
corrected with opposite rudder and brake, but the airplane veered right and exited the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 240Â° at 9 knots, gusting to 20 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 09.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing, and his subsequent failure to 
maintain directional control in gusting, right quartering tailwind conditions.
