Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that her first approach was unstable, and she aborted the landing. During 
the subsequent approach, while on the downwind leg, the tower controller advised her to be cautious of 
wake turbulence. She continued the approach, and during landing, the airplane bounced twice. She 
attempted to abort the landing, but the propeller struck the ground. She then taxied the airplane to a 
taxiway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward lower fuselage longerons and bulkheads. 
The student reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings

The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing.
