Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during the last landing of the day, which he performed in crosswind 
conditions, the tailwheel-equipped airplane bounced. He added that during the bounce, the airplane 
rolled right, and the right main landing gear touched down. Subsequently, once both main landing gear 
were on the runway the airplane veered sharply to the right and he lost directional control. The airplane 
exited the right side of the runway, the right main landing gear spindle and tire separated from the 
airplane, and the airplane came to rest. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the front spar.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system located at the accident airport reported, about the time of the 
accident, the wind was from 210Â° at 8 knots. The flight instructor landed on runway 33.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to maintain directional control during landing, in cross wind conditions.
