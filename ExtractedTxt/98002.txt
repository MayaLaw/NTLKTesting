Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane bounced multiple times, so he added power to go 
around, but the left wing dropped, and the airplane "veered" left and dropped to the ground. The airplane 
touched down in the grass to the left of the runway, the nose landing gear collapsed, and the airplane 
nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during a go-around, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.
