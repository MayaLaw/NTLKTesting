Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during an instrument meteorological conditions flight, he chose to accomplish an 
area navigation approach. He reported that he descended to his minimum descent altitude of 800 ft, 
decreased the airspeed, and began looking outside the cockpit for the runway. He recalled that the 
visibility was 3/4 mile, and that, about 20 seconds later, the airplane struck tree tops. The pilot 
immediately executed the missed approach procedure and made an approach to an alternate airport. The 
right wing sustained substantial damage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's descent below the minimum descent altitude during a nonprecision approach, which resulted 
in a tree strike.
