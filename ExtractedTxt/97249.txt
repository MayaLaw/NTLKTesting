Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
ORRVILLE, Ohio
Accident Number:
CEN18LA171
Date & Time:
May 11, 2018, 09:40 Local 
Registration:
N738XT
Aircraft:
Cessna 172N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During initial climb after a soft field takeoff, the private pilot noted that the airspeed was low, 
which he thought was due to a pitot system error. He pulled back on the yoke and the 
airplane's stall warning horn immediately sounded. The airplane was descending, and the pilot 
maneuvered to avoid obstructions. He pulled the yoke all the way back to fully stall the airplane 
before the airplane impacted the ground and nosed over. The pilot reported that there were no 
mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation. Based on the available information, it is likely that the pilot failed to attain adequate 
airspeed control during the takeoff and initial climb, which resulted in an exceedance of the 
airplane's critical angle of attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain adequate airspeed during the soft field takeoff, which resulted in an 
exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Airspeed - Not attained/maintained
Aircraft
Angle of attack - Capability exceeded
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot
