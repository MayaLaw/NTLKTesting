Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that the weather conditions were "gusty winds with 
intermittent rain" and that a quartering headwind existed at the airstrip. During initial climb, a wind gust 
forced the airplane back into ground effect, and another gust forced the airplane back onto the airstrip. 
The right main landing gear collapsed, the right wing struck the ground, and the airplane came to rest 
nose down. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind was variable at 5 knots, gusting to 22 knots. 
The pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented if he had waited for "calmer conditions." 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to take off in gusting crosswind conditions, which resulted in a loss of 
control and collision with terrain.
