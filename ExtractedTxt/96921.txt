Registration:
N925DP
Aircraft:
PFLUGRADT Kitfox
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airline transport pilot of the experimental, amateur-built airplane reported that, while flying about 
800 ft above a river during a personal flight, he advanced the throttle to climb then the engine started to 
lose power. He elected to land on a nearby island, during which the airplane nosed over. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the throttle cable set screw on the aft side of the 
throttle body arm had backed out of its original position and was no longer securing the throttle cable. 
As a result, the cable moved freely with no corresponding motion on the throttle body arm. This would 
have also resulted in the pilot's inability to adjust the engine power from the cockpit throttle control. 
Maintenance records revealed that the pilot built and installed the throttle body arm about 7 months and 
204 flight hours before the accident. In addition, a vernier-style throttle cable was installed about 6 
months and 159 flight hours before the accident. It is likely that the set screw was improperly secured 
during one of the previous maintenance events and came loose during operation, which released its hold 
on the throttle cable. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power due to an improperly secured throttle cable set screw.
