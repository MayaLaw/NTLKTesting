Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Arrey, New Mexico
Accident Number:
CEN18LA226
Date & Time:
June 15, 2018, 10:10 Local 
Registration:
N6672Q
Aircraft:
GRUMMAN ACFT ENG COR-
SCHWEIZER G 164B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Controlled flight into terr/obj (CFIT)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that he completed four agricultural application loads "just fine." 
However, after the fourth application, he turned the airplane to conduct a clean-up pass of the field, and 
subsequently, the airplane impacted the east side of a hill. The pilot stated that he did not remember 
what happened nor why it happened. 
Another pilot who had previously sprayed the accident field reported that, when flying east/west in the 
morning, the east-facing swath was into the sun and toward rapidly rising terrain. At the time of the 
accident, clear skies and light winds were present, and the sun was in the east. Given this information 
and that the operator reported that there was no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation, the pilot likely failed to maintain 
clearance from rising terrain while facing the sun during the low-level flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a hillside during an agricultural application flight while 
facing the sun.
