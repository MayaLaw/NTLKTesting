Analysis 
The pilot was on a cross-country flight with no discrepancies noted during the flight. When the 
flight arrived near the destination airport, the engine quit. The pilot attempted to troubleshoot 
the engine, but it did not restart. He diverted to an alternate nearby airport but had to perform 
an emergency off-airport landing. The pilot set up for landing, but because of the darkness he 
was not able to see exactly where to land. During the landing, the airplane struck a fence and 
seating area. The pilot reported approximately 40-45 gallons of fuel onboard at the time of the 
accident. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and tail section of the 
airplane.
An engine examination and engine ground run were performed, with no mechanical anomalies 
that would have precluded normal operation or production of horsepower.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident 
examination of the engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded 
normal operation.
