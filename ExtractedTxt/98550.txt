Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a cross-country, personal flight. He reported that, during approach to 
the destination airport, he had to manually extend the landing gear because he noticed the "down" light 
was not green. A witness who was in the airport terminal reported that he heard the pilot announce on 
the CTAF that his airplane was having "amperage" issues and that he might have to land with no radios. 
The pilot then asked him to confirm that the landing gear were extended. The witness went out to the 
taxiway and checked the landing gear status as the pilot conducted a low pass over the runway. The 
landing gear was not extended fully. The pilot stated that he attempted to go around but that the airplane 
was "sucked down" into trees by "a very strong wind" as the airplane proceeded beyond the departure 
end of the runway.
 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe 
or engine that would have precluded normal operation. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the 
alternator switch was in the "off" position, which would have prevented the battery from charging and 
likely led to there being insufficient battery power to extend the landing gear. 
 
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about the time of the accident, there 
was a right quartering headwind at 14 knots, gusting to 19 knots.
