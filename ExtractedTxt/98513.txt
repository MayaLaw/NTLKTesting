Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Milton, Florida
Accident Number:
ERA19FA020
Date & Time:
October 19, 2018, 10:00 Local 
Registration:
N107KW
Aircraft:
Bowers Flybaby
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was flying the experimental, amateur-built airplane to a nearby airport to conduct touch-and-
go takeoffs and landings. Witnesses near the accident site heard the airplane's engine power increasing 
and decreasing. One witness stated that, about 100 ft above ground level, the airplane's wings started to 
rock back and forth, then the airplane entered a roll to the left, followed by a steep uncontrolled descent 
until it impacted with trees and terrain.
Postaccident examination of the airplane, engine, and fuel system revealed no mechanical deficiencies 
that would have precluded normal operation; however, witness reports of repeated fluctuations in power 
settings, combined with a lack of rotational damage to the propeller, suggest that the engine may have 
experienced a loss of power. Although conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to serious 
carburetor icing at glide power settings, the airplane was likely en route and operating at a higher power 
setting when the engine began to experience a loss of power for reasons that could not be determined 
based on the available evidence. The accident site was located in an area of numerous fields that would 
have allowed for a forced landing; whether the pilot was attempting to maneuver to one of these fields 
could not be determined. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's exceedance of 
the airplane's critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall/spin at low altitude.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined, and the pilot's subsequent exceedance 
of the airplane's critical angle of attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude.
