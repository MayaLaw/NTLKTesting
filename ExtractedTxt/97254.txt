Analysis 
The noncertificated pilot had purchased the experimental amateur-built airplane about 1 year before the 
accident and had accrued about 4 hours of experience in the airplane make and model. His wife reported 
that the accident flight was his first actual flight in the airplane, as his previous activities had been 
limited to taxiing and a maneuver in which the airplane intentionally became momentarily airborne 
while traveling down the runway. 
An externally mounted onboard video camera recorded the pilot's entire 13-minute personal flight and 
showed that after takeoff, the airplane climbed to an altitude of about 500 to 750 ft above ground level. 
About 6 minutes after takeoff, the airplane began maneuvers consistent with an aerodynamic stall and 
spin. The airplane first banked and turned sharply right, the nose pitched down, and then the airplane 
banked and turned sharply left, descending rapidly during this sequence. Within a few seconds, the 
airplane struck a tree and then impacted the ground; the fuselage, tail boom, and wings sustained 
substantial damage. 
Examination of the airplane did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot indicated that his total flight time was about 36 hours, most of which were accrued about 20 
years before the accident. The pilot's limited overall flight experience, combined with his lack of recent 
flight training or any instruction in the accident airplane make and model, likely prevented him from 
recognizing, avoiding, and recovering from an aerodynamic stall.
