Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after completing an agricultural application flight, he returned to the airport. He 
added that, on final, he added flaps and became distracted by a spray handle that became open due to 
vibration. He took his hand off the control stick to close the spray handle, but because the airplane was 
improperly trimmed, the airplane pitched down severely. He pitched the nose up to about level, but the 
main landing gear struck the ground. The airplane bounced and impacted an irrigation system, the right 
main landing gear separated, and the airplane spun around before coming to rest.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's distraction due to a spray handle opening and his improper pitch trim setting during final 
approach, which resulted in an excessive pitchdown when he took his hand off the controls to close the 
handle.
