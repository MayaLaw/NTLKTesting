Analysis 
The commercial pilot was conducting a personal cross-country flight in a single-engine airplane with a 
passenger. After the airplane failed to arrive at the intended destination, an extensive search was 
launched; the airplane was located on a knoll consisting of trees and muskeg 3 days after it departed a 
private airstrip. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. 
A review of archived weather information for the area about the estimated time of the accident revealed 
a ceiling between 5,000 ft and 6,000 ft above ground level with forward visibility between 6 and 10 
statute miles. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical 
failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Thus, based on the available 
evidence, the investigation could not determine the exact cause of the accident.
The emergency locator transmitter was found in the "OFF" position, which prevented the beacon from 
activating and producing an audible signal, and may have contributed to the length of the search. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Undetermined based on the available evidence.
