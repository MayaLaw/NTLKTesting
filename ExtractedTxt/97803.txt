Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff, the private pilot reported to the tower controller that the airplane had experienced a 
"power failure" and would be returning to the airport. A witness reported that he observed the airplane 
flying low and trying to make a sharp turn back toward the airport and that the engine seemed like it was 
sputtering. The airplane subsequently impacted the upsloping  terrain hard, and came to an abrupt stop 
less than one mile southwest of the departure runway. All major components of the airplane were 
located at the accident site. Postaccident examination of the airframe revealed no mechanical anomalies 
that would have precluded normal operation. Although the carburetor diaphragms exhibited 
tearing/cracks, the fracture surfaces were consistent with impact damage. No other mechanical 
anomalies were observed that would have precluded normal engine operation, and the reason for the 
reported loss of engine power could not be determined.
