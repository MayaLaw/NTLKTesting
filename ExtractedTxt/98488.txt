Analysis 
Before departing on a on a local pleasure flight, the sport pilot reported that he did not activate 
the airplane’s auxiliary fuel pump, which would have replenished the header fuel tank with fuel 
from the airplane’s two main wing fuel tanks. About 5 minutes later, the airplane’s engine lost 
power when the fuel supply in the header tank was exhausted. The pilot attempted a forced 
landing, but as he maneuvered the airplane to avoid a tree, the airplane stalled and descended 
into the tree. The pilot was seriously injured and the airplane’s fuselage and wings were 
substantially damaged.
The pilot reported taking gabapentin prior to the flight. Gabapentin carries the warning, 
“patients should be advised that gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence and other 
symptoms and signs of central nervous system depression.” It is likely the impairing effects of 
gabapentin contributed to the pilot's failure to turn on the fuel pump, which led to fuel 
starvation and the loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to activate the airplane’s auxiliary fuel pump, which resulted in fuel 
starvation and a total loss of engine power. Contributing to the accident were the impairing 
effects of the pilot’s medication on his performance.
