Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Ontario, California
Accident Number:
WPR19LA021
Date & Time:
November 8, 2018, 15:53 Local 
Registration:
N9914M
Aircraft:
Cessna 182
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane encountered severe turbulence and downdrafts after flying through a mountain 
pass, and the pilot applied full engine power in an effort to arrest the descent. The engine did 
not respond, and the pilot performed a forced landing onto a highway. While the pilot 
attempted to avoid automobiles, the airplane landed hard and sustained substantial damage.
Examination revealed that about 20 years and 300 flight hours before the accident, threaded 
studs had been used to mount the carburetor airbox to the carburetor inlet, rather than the 
appropriate bolts. The studs had been overdriven and penetrated the carburetor bowl, 
fracturing the bowl housing. Fragments of the damaged housing lay at the bottom of the bowl 
until the accident flight, when the turbulence likely caused them to migrate and interfere with 
either the float or the fuel mixture metering system.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power during descent due to an incorrectly installed carburetor.
