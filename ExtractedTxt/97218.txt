Analysis 
As the twin-engine, turbopropeller-equipped airplane started to taxi for takeoff, the right main landing 
gear collapsed, deforming the aft center wing lower spar cap. A postaccident examination of the airplane 
revealed that the right main landing gear drag brace bolt failed at the wing forward attach point. As the 
airplane moved forward, the strut pivoted aft, collapsing the landing gear. The drag brace bolt was not 
retained, and the reason for its failure could not be determined based on the available information.

Failure of the right main landing gear drag brace bolt for reasons that could not be determined based on
