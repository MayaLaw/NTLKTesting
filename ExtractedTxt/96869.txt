Part 91: General aviation - Flight test
Analysis 
On the morning of the accident, the pilot performed a 2-hour test flight with newly-installed camera 
equipment, during which the airplane performed normally. While taking off on the second flight of the 
day, the pilot felt that there was something wrong with the engine. There were no abnormal indications 
and the engine continued to produce power until the pilot leveled the airplane at cruise altitude; the 
engine then lost total power and the pilot subsequently conducted a forced landing onto a road, resulting 
in substantial damage to the wings.
A test run of the engine revealed that the fuel pump was adjusted to an excessively rich fuel flow setting, 
which resulted in a loss of power when the throttle was increased past about 2,100 rpm. The fuel pump 
was readjusted and the engine performed nominally. When the fuel pump was reset to the as-received 
setting, the engine exhibited the same loss of power as during the first run. Bench testing of the throttle 
body and fuel pump revealed that both units failed to meet production standards.
Review of the airplane's maintenance records indicated that a fuel system adjustment was performed 
almost 2 years before the accident. It is likely that the improper fuel pump setting resulted in an overly 
rich fuel/air mixture and the subsequent loss of engine power; however, the reason for the loss of engine 
power during the accident flight, and not during previous flights since the fuel pump was adjusted, could 
not be determined.
