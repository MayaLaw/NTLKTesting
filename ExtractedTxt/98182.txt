Analysis 
According to the pilot, before landing on the tidal beach, he conducted two passes over the landing area 
to check for debris and determine wind direction. He stated that, after touchdown on the beach, the 
airplane felt like it had a flat tire and subsequently veered to the right. The airplane came to rest in a left-
wing-low attitude on a tidal mudflat and sustained substantial damage to the left wing, left horizontal 
stabilizer, and left elevator. 
The pilot examined the airplane and noted that both main landing gear legs had separated just above the 
main axle attach point. A laboratory examination revealed that both main landing gear legs failed due to 
fatigue cracking. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The fatigue fracture of both main landing gear legs during the landing roll, which resulted in the collapse 
and separation of both main landing gear legs.
