Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was on final approach to the destination airport at the conclusion of a cross-country 
flight when the engine lost total power. Unable to restore engine power, the pilot performed a 
forced landing to a field short of the runway, during which the airplane impacted large rocks, 
resulting in substantial damage. 
Examination of the airplane revealed about 25 total gallons of fuel onboard. Examination of the 
engine revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation, except 
for the aft boost pump, which contained a mixture of fuel and water. Given the lack of other 
anomalies and the presence of fuel onboard, it is likely that the engine ingested the fuel/water 
mixture, which resulted in the loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of engine power due to fuel contamination.
