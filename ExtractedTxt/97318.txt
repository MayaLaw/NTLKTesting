Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that he had been applying rice seed to a field throughout the day and was 
returning to land on a dirt airstrip. During the approach, the airplane encountered a downdraft, and the 
right main landing gear (MLG) impacted the top of a seed dispensing truck that was positioned near the 
approach end of the airstrip. The pilot continued the landing, and upon touchdown, the right MLG 
collapsed, the airplane veered right, crossed over a ditch, and then came to rest in a field. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right MLG attachment point to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would
