Analysis 
The pilot receiving instruction toward a commercial certificate in the tailwheel-equipped airplane 
reported that, while practicing a power-off 180° approach, upon landing, the airplane veered sharply 
right. The pilot attempted to correct with opposite rudder; however, the airplane exited the right side of 
the runway, impacted a tree, and then came to rest after impacting a house.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left and right wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
About the time of the accident, an automated weather reporting station located 5 miles west of the 
accident site reported that the wind was from 080° at 4 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 
17.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's receiving instruction's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll, which 
resulted in impact with trees and a house.
