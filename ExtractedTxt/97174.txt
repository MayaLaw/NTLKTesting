Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Shullsburg, Wisconsin
Accident Number:
CEN18LA159
Date & Time:
May 4, 2018, 19:30 Local 
Registration:
N36LP
Aircraft:
Beech A36
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that he heard an unusual noise from the engine during cruise flight and 
shortly afterward, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot performed a forced landing to 
an open field.
Visual examination of the engine revealed a hole in the crankcase. A teardown examination revealed 
fretting on the crankcase mating surfaces, shifting of the No. 2 main bearing within the journal support, 
thermal damage consistent with a loss of oil lubrication, and separation of the crankshaft. The observed 
fretting damage was consistent with relative movement of the crankcase halves during operation due to a 
lack of through-bolt torque. The main journal bearing damage, the separation of the crankshaft, and the 
crankcase damage were secondary and a result of the loss of lubrication.
An engine overhaul was completed in about 11 years 5 months before the accident; about 849 flight 
hours had accumulated since the overhaul. Two cylinders were replaced 6 years before the accident, and 
one cylinder was replaced during the most recent annual inspection about 9 months before the accident. 
It is likely that improper torque of the through-bolt nuts was applied during one of the cylinder 
replacement events, though it could not be determined which event. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A catastrophic engine failure due to improper torque on the engine through-bolt nuts, which resulted in 
relative movement between the crankcase halves, damage to a main journal bearing, and a loss of oil 
lubrication.
