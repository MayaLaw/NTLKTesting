Accident Number:
ERA18LA190
Date & Time:

Registration:
N352GL
Aircraft:
GLASAIR SH2
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While in cruise flight, the experimental, amateur-built airplane's engine started to run "rough" and lost 
partial power. The pilot checked the engine gauges, noted no irregularities, and unsuccessfully attempted 
to restore engine power by turning the fuel boost pump on. Within about 30 seconds of the initial power 
loss, the engine lost total power and the propeller stopped. The pilot performed a forced landing to a bog 
and the airplane came to rest inverted, resulting in substantial damage to the empennage.
Disassembly and examination of the engine revealed that the crankshaft had fractured at the No. 4 
cylinder journal. Further examination of the fracture surface revealed fatigue striations consistent with 
fatigue crack propagation. These striations were finely spaced and exhibited changing or erratic 
thicknesses on different areas of the fracture surface, consistent with propagation through high-cycle 
fatigue. The reason for the crack initiation could not be determined.
According to the engine maintenance log, the engine experienced a propeller strike during a landing 
incident about 5 years and 368 flight hours before the accident. The pilot elected not to have the 
propeller strike or sudden stoppage inspection performed, since it was not mandatory for non-
certificated engines.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to a fatigue fracture of the crankshaft.
