CEN17LA236
Date & Time:

Registration:
N999WX
Aircraft:
WELLS JOHN L JR STOL CH 701
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Flight test
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that, during initial climb after takeoff, the amateur-built airplane's engine 
experienced a partial loss of power. As he attempted to return to the airport, the engine lost total power. 
He subsequently conducted a forced landing on rough terrain, during which the right wing and fuselage 
sustained damage.
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the fuel hose from the left wing tank had 
deteriorated from the inside, which would have restricted the flow of fuel to the engine and led to fuel 
starvation and the subsequent loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Fuel starvation due to the deterioration of a fuel hose.
