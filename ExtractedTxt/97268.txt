Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during a soft-field takeoff, the student kept the stick back and allowed 
the airplane's nose to rise. The airplane drifted to the left and he reminded the student to apply right 
rudder and right aileron. He added that it seemed like the student applied too much right aileron, and the 
right wing was close to dragging on the runway. The flight instructor prepared to take the flight controls, 
and the student overcorrected to the left and the left wing impacted the ground. The flight instructor took 
control of the airplane, reduced power, and taxied to park without further incident.
The student pilot reported that, during a soft-field takeoff, about 30 to 35 knots, the airplane lifted off 
the ground and encountered a crosswind that rolled the airplane to the right. The right wing dragged on 
the ground, he rolled the airplane to the left, and the left wing then impacted the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left aileron.
The school's chief flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain lateral control during a soft-field takeoff.
