Part 91: General aviation - Business
Analysis 
The pilot departed in the multiengine airplane and climbed to cruise altitude. He began to lean 
the fuel mixture for cruise power and felt a vibration and fluttering. He then slowed the 
airplane, began to troubleshoot the problem and turned back toward the airport; but when he 
advanced the throttles to takeoff power, there was no response from engines. The pilot stated 
that the airplane was “losing altitude fast,” and he attempted to glide the airplane to the 
interstate for an emergency landing. Unable to reach the interstate, the pilot subsequently 
performed a gear-up, forced landing to a field, during which the airplane sustained substantial 
damage. 
The pilot reported that he was distracted by the vibration and noise and he failed to enrichen 
the fuel mixtures after beginning the leaning procedure. He stated that there were no 
mechanical anomalies that would have precluded the engines from producing full power, and 
that the vibration was the result of the engines running rough due to lack of fuel.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to properly adjust the fuel/air mixtures, which resulted in a partial loss of 
engine power to both engines due to fuel starvation and a subsequent forced landing to a field.
