Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during the instructional flight in a tailwheel-equipped airplane, the 
student pilot bounced the landing. The airplane bounced off the grass airstrip, and the flight instructor 
took the flight controls, but the airplane drifted to the left and into a drainage ditch. The flight instructor 
reported that he corrected with right rudder application to ease the airplane out of the ditch, but the left 
landing gear tire deflated, and the left wing and the tail struck the ground. The airplane yawed to the left, 
the instructor corrected the yaw, and the airplane rolled onto the runway and stopped. The left wing, left 
aileron, and the elevator sustained substantial damage.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with 
the airplane that would have prevented normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing, and the flight 
instructor's inability to recover the airplane, which resulted in a runway excursion.
