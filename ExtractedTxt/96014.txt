Date & Time:
September 13, 2017, 17:17 Local 
Registration:
N5906F
Aircraft:
Cessna 210G
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, while in cruise flight, a total loss of engine power occurred. After 
unsuccessful attempts to restart the engine, he landed the airplane gear up in a cornfield, which resulted 
in substantial damage to the fuselage. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the engine 
mixture control cable had fractured about 9 inches from its attachment point at the engine. A 
metallurgical examination of the mixture control cable with a scanning electron microscope revealed 
fracture surface features that were consistent with a fatigue failure. It is likely that the engine mixture 
control cable fractured in flight, which led to a total loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power due to a fatigue failure of the engine mixture control cable.
Findings
Aircraft
(general) - Fatigue/wear/corrosion
