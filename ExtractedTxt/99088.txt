Analysis 
On March 10, 2019, at 2117 eastern daylight time, Delta Airlines flight 1068, a Boeing 737 
(B737), N3756, collided with Delta Airlines flight 2777, a Boeing 757 (B757), N591NW while 
taxiing along taxiway B at the Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL), 
Atlanta, Georgia. There were no injuries to the passengers and crew onboard either airplane, 
and the B757 was substantially damaged. Both aircraft were operating under 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 121 as regularly scheduled passenger flights. 
The B757 had landed on runway 26R and was holding short of runway 26L at taxiway B2, 
awaiting clearance to cross the runway and taxi to the ramp. The B737 had landed following 
the B757 and was cleared to taxi along taxiway B to the Victor Loop. When approaching B2 on 
B, the B737 crew reported taxiing to the right of centerline to provide clearance with the B757 
tail on their left. The B737 left wingtip contacted the B757 tail resulting in a light shudder on 
both aircraft. The B757 crew reported on ground frequency that they had been hit and the B737 
crew acknowledged they may have hit them when passing along taxiway B.  The B757 remained 
on the taxiway until maintenance had evaluated the damage, then taxied to the gate and 
deplaned. The B737 continued taxiing to the gate and deplaned.  Post-accident inspection 
revealed substantial damage to the right elevator of the B757 and minor damage to the left 
winglet of the B737.
