Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during landing, as the nosewheel touched down on the runway, he 
felt a "strong vibration," and the airplane veered left. He tried to correct by pulling back on the yoke, but 
the airplane became airborne and continued veering left, and the left wing impacted a ramp left of the 
runway.
Examination of video surveillance revealed that, shortly after landing, the airplane veered left. The 
airplane then became airborne, aerodynamically stalled, and the left wing dropped and impacted the 
ramp.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The manager reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll and his exceedance of the 
airplane's critical angle of attack when it inadvertently became airborne, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.
