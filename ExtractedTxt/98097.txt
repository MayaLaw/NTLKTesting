Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting an agricultural application flight in the turboprop-equipped airplane. Data 
from an onboard GPS unit showed that the airplane had completed 10 spray passes on a field, making 
right 180° turns after each pass to align the airplane for the subsequent pass. The airplane would climb 
between 500-700 ft during the first 90° of the turn, then descend during the second 90° of the turn. The 
airplane's groundspeed decayed to between 37 kts and 63 kts during the previous turns; however, the 
data did not capture the accident turn. A witness stated that he saw the airplane complete a spray pass, 
pull up into a near-vertical attitude, then become inverted. The airplane descended straight down and 
was starting to pull up when it hit the ground.
The airplane impacted terrain in a wings-level, nose-low attitude. No preimpact anomalies of the 
airframe, engine, or propeller were found. Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the pilot 
failed to maintain sufficient airspeed during a turn following a spray pass, which resulted in exceedance 
of the airplane's critical angle of attack, an aerodynamic stall, and loss of airplane control at an altitude 
too low for recovery.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed while maneuvering, which resulted in exceedance of the 
airplane's critical angle of attack, an aerodynamic stall, and loss of control at an altitude too 
low for recovery.
