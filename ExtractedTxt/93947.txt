Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while maneuvering at low altitude over a field during an agricultural application 
flight, the airplane struck an antenna atop a tower adjacent to the field, and the antenna wrapped around 
the right wing and landing gear. The pilot added that he attempted an off-airport landing, but the 
airplane impacted terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and 
both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
In an e-mail, the tower owner's lawyer reported that the tower was used for internet and two-way 
communications. He added that the tower was under 200 ft above ground level and "with the antenna 
attached, the tower was in the mid to upper 100 [foot] range." The lawyer reported that the tower was 
marked and lit appropriately and was not registered due its height.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from an antenna atop a tower while maneuvering at a low 
altitude and the airplane's subsequent impact with terrain during an attempted off-airport landing.
