Analysis 
About 10 nautical miles from the destination during a cross-country flight, the airplane's engine began to 
run rough, cut in and out, and surge. The pilot checked the header fuel tank level and noted that it was 
nearly full, and he activated the electrically driven fuel pump, but the engine issues continued. The 
airplane continued to lose altitude and the engine continued to run rough; about 1,000 ft above the 
ground and about two nautical miles from the destination airport, the pilot decided to reduce engine 
power to idle and complete a precautionary landing in a field. During the landing roll, the airplane 
impacted a dirt pile and nosed over, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and 
wings.
Fuel was found in the bowls of both carburetors and in both wing tanks and the header tank. 
Examination of the engine found no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have 
precluded normal operation, and when the engine was test run from an external fuel source using the 
engine-driven fuel pump, it started and produced power at multiple power settings.
Given the presence of fuel and the lack of anomalies found during the postaccident engine test run, it is 
possible that the fuel supply to the engine was partially interrupted, which resulted in the engine 
continuing to run rough to the extent that maintaining altitude was not possible; however, the reason for 
the interruption of the fuel supply could not be determined.
