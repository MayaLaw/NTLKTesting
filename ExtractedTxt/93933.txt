Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot and one passenger departed in a vintage airplane from a private airstrip. During 
the takeoff, the airplane would not climb with full engine power, and it collided with trees about 1/2 
mile from the end of the runway. 
An examination of the airplane revealed that the flaps were in the "down" position. However, the Before 
Takeoff checklist stated, "flaps up," for takeoff. The pilot reported that he normally took off with one 
notch of flaps. It is likely that the pilot's failure to follow the Before Takeoff checklist and his use of the 
wrong flaps setting for takeoff degraded the airplane's climb performance.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to follow the Before Takeoff checklist and his improper use of flaps during takeoff, 
which degraded the airplane's climb performance and resulted in a collision with trees.
