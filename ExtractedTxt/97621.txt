Registration:
N151QC
Aircraft:
GRUMMAN ACFT ENG COR-
SCHWEIZER G 164
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during an agricultural application flight, he misjudged the approach and did not 
have enough clearance to avoid power lines. The airplane began to sink, and he pulled back on the flight 
control stick. Subsequently, the airplane aerodynamically stalled and then struck power lines.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's misjudgment of the approach and his subsequent exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of 
attack during an agricultural application flight, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and collision with 
power lines.
