Analysis 
The pilot of the float-equipped airplane reported that, during takeoff from a private lake, the float plane 
did not "climb as the day before." Upon reaching the end of the lake, he "pulled up hard" on the yoke to 
avoid power lines, but the "left wing [stalled]," and the float plane impacted the ground. 
The float plane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot added that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 190° at 12 knots, gusting to 21 
knots. An automated weather observation station about 5 nautical miles from the accident site reported 
that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 190° at 11 knots. The airplane departed the lake 
with a 180° heading. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during takeoff as he attempted to avoid 
power lines, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
