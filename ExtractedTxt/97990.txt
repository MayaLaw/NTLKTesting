Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Watkins, Minnesota
Accident Number:
CEN18LA311
Date & Time:
August 2, 2018, 10:35 Local 
Registration:
N5523S
Aircraft:
Cessna 188
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
During the agricultural application flight, the commercial pilot noticed a loss of engine speed (rpm) after 
completing an application pass. He subsequently observed a decrease in engine oil pressure combined 
with an increase in oil temperature. As he returned for a forced landing to the corn field being sprayed, 
the oil pressure was about 7 psi. The pilot indicated that the engine was "coughing" at that point, and he 
decided to shut the engine down; the loss of engine power was not catastrophic. He subsequently landed 
in the field, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
A postaccident examination revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that 
would have precluded normal operation. Thus, the reason for the partial loss of engine power could not 
be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because a postaccident 
examination revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have 
precluded normal operation.
