Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during approach to a private airstrip, the electronic primary flight display 
reported that the wind was from the south at 16 knots. He added that, upon touchdown, the airplane 
quickly veered left. He added power to correct, and "the addition of power was enough to lift the 
airplane slightly, but not to take off again, and so after [the airplane] floated a short distance, [it] landed 
again off the side of the runway." The nose landing gear collapsed in the dirt.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control and runway heading during landing, which resulted in 
a runway excursion and the nose landing gear collapsing.
