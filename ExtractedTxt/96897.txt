Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while conducting touch-and-go landings in the local pattern at night, the wind 
increased and began to gust during the third approach. He added that, he applied full power and 
performed a go-around. During the next landing, the airplane touched down, and the wind "increased 
and shifted" to the right. Subsequently, the airplane exited the left side of the runway and came to rest 
inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the windshield, and the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system located at the accident airport reported that, about the time 
of the accident, the wind was from 230Â° at 19 knots, gusting to 23 knots. The pilot landed on runway 20.
Probable Cause and Findings
