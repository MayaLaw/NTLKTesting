Analysis 
The pilot stated that he intended to fly in the airport traffic pattern after routine maintenance work. He 
noted no anomalies in the preflight inspection of the airplane or the engine runup and noted that the fuel 
was "to the tabs." He flew the normal traffic pattern and extended the downwind leg to allow time for 
another airplane in the traffic pattern. After reaching an altitude of about 500 ft above ground level on 
the base leg, he attempted to add power to maintain altitude. The engine did not respond, and the pilot 
noted that the tachometer indicated 2,000 rpm and was decreasing. The pilot attempted to restart the 
engine, but it did not respond, and the airplane continued to descend. During the forced landing to a 
baseball field, the airplane impacted power lines and subsequently impacted the ground tail-first. 
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failures or 
malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation, and the reason for the loss of engine power 
could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
