Registration:
N838JH
Aircraft:
Piper PA28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was in cruise flight in the single-engine airplane when the engine started to run rough. He 
applied carburetor heat, but the engine continued to run rough. He noticed that the fuel pressure gauge 
indicated 0, so he turned on the electric fuel boost pump, which did not restore power. He then switched 
fuel tanks, which momentarily restored engine power. The pilot decided to divert to a nearby airport and 
continued to switch between fuel tanks to obtain short bursts of engine power. During landing, the 
airplane departed the runway surface and the nose landing gear collapsed.
Examination of the fuel system found available fuel in the tanks and only a small amount of debris in the 
gascolator. Both the engine-driven and electric fuel boost pumps were removed from the airplane. Hand 
testing of the engine-driven pump found suction and pressure at the inlet and outlet ports. Testing of the 
electric boost pump revealed that liquid would not flow when activated. Despite the failure of the 
electric boost pump, it was not indicated for use in cruise flight, and its failure should not have resulted 
in a loss of fuel flow. It is possible that an unidentified fuel restriction prevented fuel from getting to the 
engine-driven fuel pump; however, the reason for or source of the fuel restriction could not be 
determined during postaccident examination. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power due to a restriction in fuel flow for undetermined reasons.
