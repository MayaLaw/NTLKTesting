Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Willow, Alaska
Accident Number:
ANC19LA005
Date & Time:
November 1, 2018, 16:30 Local 
Registration:
N3227M
Aircraft:
Piper PA 12
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the pilot, during the initial climb on the personal flight, the engine backfired and then lost 
total power. He was unable to restore power, and during the subsequent off-airport forced landing, the 
airplane collided with a stand of trees, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. 
A mechanic/friend of the pilot stated that this was the first flight after engine maintenance, during which 
he and the pilot had been troubleshooting for excessive magneto drops and a cold cylinder. He added 
that they had just reinstalled the fine wire spark plugs after cleaning them.
A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that all spark plugs exhibited normal operational 
signatures with no defects or anomalies noted. Both magnetos produced spark at all terminals as 
designed. The impulse coupler inside the left magneto was fractured, but that did not preclude the 
magneto from sparking. Additionally, the wiring harness from the ignition switch to the magnetos was 
frayed and separated. However, it could not be determined if the separation occurred as a result of the 
accident. Thus, the reason(s) for the loss of engine power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power shortly after takeoff for reasons that could not be determined based on the 
available information, which resulted in an emergency landing and collision with trees.
