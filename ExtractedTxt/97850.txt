Registration:
N3169H

Air Tractor AT 301
Aircraft Damage:

Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The operator reported that, during takeoff for an agricultural application flight, the airplane "quickly 
whipped" left almost immediately after becoming airborne. Subsequently, the airplane impacted a 
cornfield and then came to rest about 70 ft west of the runway.
Postaccident airframe examination did not reveal evidence of any preimpact anomalies with the flight 
control system that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot reported that there were no issues 
with the engine during the takeoff. The pilot added that he commonly used a gentle rise in the runway to 
assist the airplane to become airborne during takeoff; however, the investigation could not determine if 
this played a role in the loss of airplane control. Based on the available evidence, the investigation could 
not determine the reason for the pilot's loss of airplane control.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of airplane control during takeoff for reasons that could not be determined because no 
anomalies consistent with a flight control system malfunction were observed.
