Analysis 
The pilots reported that, while taxiing to the runway for departure, the nose wheel steering seemed 
unusually sensitive and the airplane pulled slightly to the right. As they neared the runway threshold, 
they smelled what they thought to be overheated brakes. The crew confirmed the position of the parking 
brake handle, which had not been fully stowed, and once the handle was completely stowed (parking 
brake OFF position), the airplane moved more freely. The crew then cancelled their takeoff clearance 
and taxied the airplane to the runup area to allow the brakes to cool. Shortly thereafter, the control tower 
notified the flight crew that the airplane was on fire.
Examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the underside of the fuselage and right wing 
due to fire that originated at the right main landing gear. A detailed examination of the airplane’s brake 
system revealed no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal 
operation. A review of the cockpit voice recorder information confirmed that the crew did not 
completely release the parking brake before taxi.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight crew’s failure to fully disengage the parking brake before taxi, which resulted in a brake fire.
