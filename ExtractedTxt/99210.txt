Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane was configured with flaps 30° and that 
the airspeed was 70 knots. When the airplane was over the runway, he reduced the throttle to idle and 
initiated the landing flare. The airplane descended rapidly, landed hard, and bounced. He aborted the 
landing, "but the wind caught me and the next thing I knew, I was facing the taxiway." The airplane 
exited the left side of the runway into grass and nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing lift strut.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The METAR at the airport reported that, at the time of the accident, the wind was from 050° at 12 knots, 
gusting to 20 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 32.
According to the manufacturer's Pilot's Operating Handbook, the maximum demonstrated crosswind is 
15 knots. The crosswind component for the accident flight was 16 knots. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing, and his subsequent failure to 
maintain directional control in gusting crosswind conditions that exceeded the airplane's demonstrated 
crosswind for landing, which resulted in a runway excursion and nose-over.
