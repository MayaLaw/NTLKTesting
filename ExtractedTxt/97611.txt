Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during takeoff from a private, grass airstrip,

airplane ground looped to the left, and the right wing impacted the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
