Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was flying the airplane on the first flight of a 10-hour break-in period after an 
engine overhaul. The preflight inspection and ground operations were normal, with no signs of oil leaks. 
About 35 minutes into the flight, oil appeared on both windscreens, blocking the pilotâ€™s forward 
visibility; the windscreens eventually became completely covered with oil. The pilot contacted tower 
personnel, who cleared him to land. The engine then lost partial power. Tower personnel reported smoke 
coming from the engine. Unable to make the runway, the pilot chose to land the airplane in a field. After 
landing, the airplane collided with a ditch and came to rest. The engine caught fire, and the pilot 
egressed the airplane. A postcrash fire consumed most of the wreckage.
Examination of the engine revealed a large hole in the top of the engine case adjacent to the No. 2 
cylinder. The No. 2 connecting rod was fractured at the crankshaft. The connecting rod failure was 
likely the result of oil starvation to the crankshaft. Extensive postcrash fire damage to the engine, hoses, 
and accessories prevented investigators from determining the source of the oil leak.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A substantial oil leak, which resulted in a partial loss of engine power and failure of the No. 2 
connecting rod.
