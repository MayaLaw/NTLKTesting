Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot and five passengers were departing the airport on an international cross-country flight. The 
pilot attempted an intersection takeoff in high density altitude conditions over the airplane's maximum 
gross weight. The airplane would not become airborne, so the pilot back taxied and attempted to take off 
on the full length of another runway. The airplane lifted off but was not climbing, so the pilot lowered 
the nose and the airplane hit the runway hard. The airplane veered right and exited the runway surface, 
which resulted in substantial damage to the wings. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airplane or engine that would have precluded normal operation and that 
he attempted the takeoff in an overweight airplane at a high density altitude. Calculations showed that 
the airplane's maximum gross takeoff weight was exceeded by at least 300 lbs, and the density altitude 
was about 6,900 ft. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to attempt to take off in an overweight airplane in high density altitude conditions, 
which resulted in the airplane's inability to climb, an aborted takeoff, and a subsequent runway 
excursion.
