Analysis 
During the climb after takeoff, the pilot noticed a drop in engine oil pressure and turned back toward the 
airport to land. Almost immediately thereafter, the engine began to run rough and eventually lost power 
completely. The pilot performed a forced landing to an interstate exit ramp, during which the airplane 
sustained substantial damage.
Examination of the engine revealed that the Nos. 2 and 4 connecting rods were separated from their 
respective rod journals. All rod journals were absent of lubrication and displayed heat damage. 
Disassembly of the engine and the separation of the case halves revealed abnormal wear and damage 
consistent with loss of lubrication. Examination and testing of engine accessories revealed no anomalies 
that would have prevented normal operation.
The engine was equipped with a screw-on oil filter adaptor required to be torqued to 65 ft/lbs at 
installation, and the integrity of the oil filter adaptor installation was required to be examined during 
every 100-hour and annual inspection. The adaptor on the accident engine was found loose and could be 
easily rotated by hand through a 90Â° arc, and oil seepage was found on the area surrounding the oil filter 
adapter attachment point. Given this information, it is likely that the loose adaptor allowed the engine oil 
to be pumped overboard, resulting in a loss of engine lubrication and catastrophic failure of the Nos. 2 
and 4 connecting rods.
