Analysis 
While on approach to the destination airport in visual meteorological conditions, the airplane deviated 
unannounced from its intended flight path, descended, and impacted the ground. Postaccident 
examination of the airframe, flight controls, engines, engine systems, and propellers revealed no 
evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Remains of a 3.8-pound Black Vulture was found in the 
wreckage. A rear seat headrest and two inflatable lift vests located about 440 ft from the main wreckage 
were found to contain either DNA and/or microscopic feathers from a Black Vulture. Because the Black 
Vulture was located among the wreckage and because the airplaneâ€™s flight path deviation was 
unannounced, it is likely that the Black Vulture directly impacted and then penetrated the windshield in 
front of the pilot's position, which incapacitated him, resulting in an uncontrolled descent. The airplane 
was certificated in accordance with Civil Air Regulation 3, which specified no minimum standard for 
window or windshield structure strength, or bird penetration.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Incapacitation of the pilot due to a birdstrike through the windshield in front of the pilot's 
position, while on approach to land.
