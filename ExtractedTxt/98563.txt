Analysis 
The pilot reported that he entered a left traffic pattern for runway 30 during night, visual meteorological 
conditions. Although the pilot thought he had sufficient altitude during the initial phase of the final 
approach based on his altimeter indication, shortly after turning to final approach, the airplane impacted 
terrain. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage, and the three occupants were 
not injured.
Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preaccident mechanical 
failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. The examination did reveal that 
the altimeter had an incorrect setting, which resulted in an altimeter indication error of +800 ft mean sea 
level. The pilot stated that he must have had the incorrect altimeter setting for the destination airport. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's incorrect altimeter setting during the night visual approach, which resulted in a controlled 
flight into terrain.
