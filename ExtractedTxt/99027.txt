Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff, the pilot noticed that the crew hatch door, located next to the left front seat, had 
unexpectedly opened. The pilot attempted to close the door without success. He indicated that, while 
trying to close the door, he "wasn't able to fully control the airplane normally (mainly [in] heading and 
pitch)," so he initiated a precautionary landing back to the departure airport. While maneuvering at a low 
altitude to stay in visual flight rules conditions (overcast ceiling at 300 ft), the airplane's airspeed 
decreased, the wing tips were dipping back and forth, and the airplane exhibited signs of nearing its 
critical angle of attack. The pilot retracted the landing gear and applied full engine power to try to gain 
airspeed. The pilot was unable to gain airspeed, and the airplane was losing altitude. Before impact, the 
pilot kept the wings level and the nose in a slight pitch-up attitude. The airplane then impacted the snow-
covered terrain with the landing gear retracted, which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing and 
aileron. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no preimpact malfunctions with the crew 
hatch door; thus, it is likely the door had not been properly secured before takeoff.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to properly secure the crew hatch door before takeoff, which resulted in his distraction 
and his failure to maintain airplane control and airspeed.
