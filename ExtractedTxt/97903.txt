N2705B

Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Ferry
Analysis 
The airplane had not operated for about 7 years and the pilot was relocating it from Texas to Florida for 
repairs under a special flight permit (ferry permit) issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
Before departing on the flight, both main landing gear bungies were replaced, and their replacement was 
documented during the FAA's pre-ferry flight inspection. During the third stop of the trip, the airplane's 
right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane veered off the side of the runway, resulting in 
substantial damage. 
Postaccident examination revealed that the right landing gear bungies were missing; however, the 
airplane was removed from the accident site before the examination could take place, and whether the 
bungies separated before or after the accident could not be determined. No further testing or examination 
of the landing gear was performed, and the reason for the gear collapse was not determined based on the 
available information.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A collapse of the right main landing gear for reasons that could not be determined based on the 
available information.
