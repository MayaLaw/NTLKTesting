Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, upon touchdown, he maintained aft pressure on the control yoke to 
keep the nose landing gear (NLG) off the runway, but the airplane bounced. The main landing gear 
touched down again hard, followed by the NLG, which then collapsed, and the left wing impacted the 
grass adjacent the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. 
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard, bounced landing and nose landing 
gear collapse.
