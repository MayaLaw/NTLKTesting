Analysis 
After descending with the engine power above 2,000 rpm, the pilot entered the traffic pattern for the 
destination airport. Just after turning onto the base leg of the pattern, the pilot applied the carburetor heat 
and the engine “faltered” and lost partial power. The pilot then deactivated the carburetor heat, and the 
engine regained some power. He reapplied the carburetor heat, and the engine stopped. He attempted to 
restart the engine but was unsuccessful. While performing a forced landing to a road, the right wing 
impacted a utility pole and the airplane rolled over and sustained substantial damage to both wings and 
the fuselage.
The weather conditions at the time of the accident were favorable for carburetor icing at altitude and at 
the surface. It is likely that carburetor ice developed during the descent; when the pilot applied the 
carburetor heat while in the traffic pattern, the ice began to melt, which introduced water into the engine 
intake and resulted in the engine losing partial power. The pilot’s subsequent cycling of the carburetor 
heat at a relatively low power setting likely resulted in the total loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to carburetor icing. Contributing was the pilot’s failure to leave the 
carburetor heat on fully after his initial application of carburetor heat.
