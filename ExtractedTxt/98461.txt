Analysis 
The pilot and passenger departed on a cross-country flight in a single-engine airplane. Shortly after 
takeoff and about 500 ft above ground level, the engine "surged." The pilot turned the airplane back 
toward the airport; however, the engine lost power. The pilot recognized the airplane would not make it 
back to the airport, so he deployed the airplane's parachute. The airplane descended under the parachute 
into a parking lot and impacted a parked automobile, which resulted in substantial damage to the 
airplane.
The engine examination and test run noted that the engine fuel flow was high and above specified 
engine and airframe manufacturers' limits. 
Data from the airplane's data monitor also indicated that the airplane engine's fuel flow was high on the 
accident flight and on previous flights, although the maximum fuel flow recorded varied. A review of 
maintenance records revealed that the engine manifold pressure and fuel flow were adjusted in 
accordance with the manufacturer's maintenance manual about 3 months before the accident. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to excessive fuel flow.
