Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot completed a 25-minute flight before a passenger boarded the airplane for the accident flight. 
After a normal takeoff, the engine lost all power during the initial climb. The pilot switched the fuel 
selector to the other tank. Unable to restore engine power, the pilot attempted to land in an open field to 
the left of the departure runway; the airplane landed hard, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage 
and wings.
Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact mechanical 
malfunction or failure, and the exact quantity of fuel onboard at the time of the accident could not be 
determined due to impact damage. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined 
based on the available information. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
Findings
Not determined
