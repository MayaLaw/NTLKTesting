Analysis 
The noncertificated pilot reported that, while on approach for landing at the private turf runway, he was 
"blinded by the sun" and allowed the airplane to descend too low. The tailwheel hit vines growing near 
the runway, and the left wing subsequently impacted the ground, resulting in substantial damage. The 
pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions of the airplane and added that the 
accident may have been prevented by landing at a different time or by clearing the vegetation around the 
runway. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The non-certificated pilot's failure to maintain an appropriate glidepath while landing toward 
the sun, which resulted in impact with vegetation and a subsequent loss of control.
