Registration:
N426KS
Aircraft:
SHELL JOHN SUPER SIX
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot, who was the owner of the experimental airplane that was equipped with a vintage 
radial engine, decided to take the airplane around the airport traffic pattern. He recalled that 
he conducted a preflight inspection and remembered a portion of the takeoff, but did not recall 
the events of the accident. A witness reported that the engine was “sputtering” before the 
airplane impacted trees about 3,500 ft from the departure end of the runway; a postimpact fire 
ensued. 
The propeller exhibited little rotational damage, consistent with low or no engine power at the 
time of impact. Given these signatures and the witness description of the engine “sputtering,” it 
is likely that the engine lost either partial or total power. A small amount of fuel was discovered 
in the fuel sump; however, the total fuel onboard the airplane at the time of the accident could 
not be determined. The engine sustained impact and postimpact fire damage. Subsequent 
examination of the additional systems, specifically the fuel system, was inconclusive due to the 
severe impact and postimpact fire damage; therefore, the reason for the loss of engine power 
could not be determined based on the available information.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power and impact with trees and terrain for reasons that could not be 
determined based on the available information.
