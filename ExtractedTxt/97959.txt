Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped, experimental, amateur-built airplane reported that, during the 
landing roll at his home airport, the left main landing gear (MLG) wheel exited the asphalt runway and 
entered gravel that bordered the runway. The pilot applied right rudder to steer the airplane back onto 
the runway, but at the point where the left MLG tire contacted the asphalt runway, the left MLG 
collapsed. The left wing struck the ground, and the airplane came to rest on the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing spar and aileron.
The pilot reported that the left MLG shock absorber shaft had sheared off at the lock nut attached to the 
rod end, which he believed resulted in the left MLG collapsing. However, photographs provided by 
Federal Aviation Administration air safety inspectors revealed that the left MLG failed inward and 
underneath the fuselage of the airplane. Additionally, the photographs revealed ground scars on the 
asphalt runway from the left wing that could be traced from the runway centerline, about 90Â° back to 
that of the runway heading. Further, photographs revealed that the airplane was equipped with tundra 
tires, which would have put a lot of stress on the landing gear. The evidence indicates that the left MLG 
collapsed when the pilot attempted to steer the airplane back onto the runway.
The METAR at the airport reported that the wind about the time of the accident was variable at 3 knots, 
gusting to 12 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 16.
