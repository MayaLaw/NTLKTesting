Analysis 
The pilot reported that he heard a "horrible noise" and that the engine "immediately seized" about 10 
minutes from the destination airport. Oil covered the windshield and obstructed his forward field of 
view. He executed a forced landing to a road by holding the airplane in a right crab so that he could see 
out of the left side window. The airplane came to rest inverted in the grass adjacent to the road and 
sustained damage to the fuselage and wings.
A postaccident engine examination revealed that the No. 4 and No. 6 connecting rods had fractured and 
separated from the crankshaft. Metallurgical examination was unable to determine the source of the 
initial failure due to secondary mechanical damage. The intact fracture surfaces that were available for 
examination exhibited features consistent with overstress.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to a connecting rod failure for reasons that could not be determined due to 
secondary mechanical damage, which resulted in a subsequent forced landing.
