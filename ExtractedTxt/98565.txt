Analysis 
The commercial pilot was practicing approaches and touch-and-go landings. The pilot 
reported that, during taxi for takeoff, the wheel brakes were "sluggish"; when he was 
attempting a full-stop landing at the destination airport, the brakes "failed." The pilot steered 
the airplane off the runway to avoid a fence and collided with a ditch, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the left wing. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that 
the left main landing gear separated from the airplane during the ground collision, and there 
was evidence of pre-existing hydraulic fluid leakage where the fluid line fitting connected to the 
wheel brake assembly. Additionally, the right main landing gear wheel brake assembly was not 
attached to the trunnion by the required AN bolts, and the hydraulic fluid line fitting was not 
attached to the brake assembly. According to the maintenance logbooks, a 100-hour 
inspection was completed 18 days before the accident. The logbook entry noted servicing of 
all tires, wheels, brakes, and brake fluid. Given that the right main landing gear hydraulic fluid 
line was detached from its respective brake assembly, it is likely that maintenance personnel 
did not adequately inspect the wheel brake system, and the right brake failed due to a loss of 
hydraulic fluid.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Maintenance personnel's inadequate inspection of the wheel brake system during the 
airplane's most recent 100-hour inspection, which resulted in a loss of hydraulic fluid and the 
pilot's inability to control the airplane during the landing.
