Analysis 
The pilot flew a visual approach to a 1,712-ft-long by 120-ft-wide turf runway. During touchdown, the 
airplane bounced and the pilot "felt out of control." The pilot executed a late go-around, during which 
the airplane struck a fence at the end of the airport property. Then, due to approaching trees, the pilot 
attempted to make a turn, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall. The airplane subsequently impacted 
terrain and came to rest inverted, which damaged the tail.
