Analysis 
The private pilot reported that the experimental, amateur-built airplane inadvertently became airborne 
during a high-speed taxi test. Two witnesses said that the airplane was in level flight about 200 ft above 
ground level and heading toward a tree line when the engine lost power. The airplane abruptly nosed 
straight down, struck a backyard playground set and hickory trees, and impacted the ground. The 
airplane came to rest upright about 5 ft from the initial impact crater and about 1/2 mile from the 
departure end of the pilot's private runway. The engine was not examined, and the pilot did not respond 
to inquiries regarding the accident.
