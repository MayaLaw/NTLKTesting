Analysis 
The pilot reported that he had departed on a local flight and leveled the airplane at 2,600 ft mean sea 
level when he observed a drop in engine rpm and heard a "thumping" sound from the engine. The pilot 
reversed course to return to the airport; the noise increased, he smelled burning oil, and the engine 
subsequently quit. The pilot conducted a forced landing to a field, during which the nose landing gear 
collapsed and the wings sustained substantial damage. 
An examination of the airplane revealed no oil on the engine dipstick; however, oil was coming out of 
the oil cooler, and oil was visible on the right side of the cowling. Maintenance records indicated that the 
engine, including the oil cooler, was new and had been installed about 8 hours before the accident flight. 
An examination of the oil cooler revealed that the leak came from between the plates forming the oil 
circuit; it was likely due to a defect in the brazed joint between the plates. The engine lost power due to 
oil starvation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the oil cooler due to a defect in the brazed joint, which resulted in a loss of engine power 
due to oil starvation.
