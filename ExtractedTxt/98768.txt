Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Valparaiso, Indiana
Accident Number:
CEN19FA044
Date & Time:
December 13, 2018, 10:44 Local 
Registration:
N6785P
Aircraft:
Piper PA24
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was departing on a personal flight. Witness observations and surveillance video 
captured the airplane during the initial climb; the right wing dropped and then the airplane 
entered a right spin.  A surveillance video from a camera mounted on a building near the 
accident captured the final portion of the accident sequence; the airplane completed one 
revolution in the spin before it impacted the ground in a near vertical attitude. Examination of 
the airplane, engine, and systems revealed no evidence of any preimpact anomalies. The 
circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's failure to maintain adequate 
airspeed during the initial climb after takeoff, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's 
critical angle of attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall and spin.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to&nbsp;maintain adequate airspeed during the initial climb after takeoff, 
which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and a subsequent 
aerodynamic stall and spin.
