Analysis 
The student pilot was conducting solo touch-and-go landings and takeoffs. During the landing roll of the 
eighth touch-and-go landing, he retracted the flaps to 0Â° and applied full engine power for takeoff. The 
airplane began drifting "hard" to the left, and he applied right rudder; however, the airplane departed the 
left side of the runway, impacted a runway marker, and came to rest in a nose-down attitude. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall. The student reported that there were no 
preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation.
