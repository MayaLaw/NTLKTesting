Analysis 
**This report was modified on September 15, 2022. Please see the public docket for this 
accident to view the original report.**
A witness reported that the airplane overflew the area, about 500 ft above ground level, before 
it descended and leveled out. The airplane was in a wings-level attitude when the left wing 
struck a lone tree that was about 60–70 ft tall. The surrounding trees in the area were about 
30–50 ft tall. The airplane continued for about 500 feet before it impacted a forested area and 
came to rest nose-down against a tree. The witness further reported that the engine was 
running at the time of the accident.
Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Toxicology testing detected a low concentration of the opiate morphine in the pilot-rated 
passenger’s urine specimen but not in the blood specimen, which suggests use was not recent 
and any sedating effects would not be present. Therefore, the effects of the pilot-rated 
passenger’s use of morphine were not a factor in the accident.
It is likely that the pilot did not see the tree that was taller than the surrounding trees while 
maneuvering at low altitude.
