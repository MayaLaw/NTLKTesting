Analysis 
According to the pilot, he made a straight-in approach about 80 knots and full flaps on final. He initiated 
the landing flare and "felt a slight sink in lift," which resulted in a hard landing. He reported that the 
airplane bounced four times with each bounce increasing in height and magnitude. Subsequently, he 
taxied the airplane to the nearest intersection but was unable to continue because the airplane was 
"taxiing rough", and he believed that the nose landing gear tire was damaged. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left and right fuselage stringers. 
Additionally, the pilot asserted that proper trim application could have helped to prevent this accident 
and that he should have aborted the landing after the first hard bounce. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing.
