Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, on short final, he decided to go around. He added that, during the 
go-around, the airplane "developed a severe vibration," so he made a precautionary landing with the gear 
retracted. The airplane slid, exited the runway, and impacted terrain. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the external longerons on the lower fuselage and engine 
mounts. 
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear during landing, which resulted in a runway excursion and 
subsequent impact with terrain.
