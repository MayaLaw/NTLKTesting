Analysis 
The private pilot reported that he was maneuvering at an altitude of about 500 ft over an unpopulated 
area and studying the river when the airplane must have gone below 500 ft and hit something. A fire 
started, and the airplane subsequently crashed in the river and sustained substantial damage to the 
fuselage and both wings. The pilot reported that he was later told that he hit a power line.
The river runs generally east to west. The power lines were about 200 ft tall, ran across the river 
generally north and south, and extended about 1 mile. The wreckage was located about 2,000 ft east of 
the power lines in about 3 ft of water. Power line company personnel reported that six power lines were 
found separated.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot likely was not vigilant in monitoring the 
environment for obstructions and did not maintain a sufficient altitude to avoid the power lines.
