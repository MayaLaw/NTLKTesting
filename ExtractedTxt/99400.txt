Analysis 
The pilot reported that the approach for landing was uneventful, and he selected the landing gear lever to 
the extended position. When the airplane touched down, the landing gear collapsed. 
The landing gear circuit breaker was found in the out position during postaccident examination. The 
airplane was placed on jacks and a gear swing test was conducted. During the test, the electric motor that 
drove the landing gear was noted to be "weak"; gear retraction was slow and the gear would only 
partially extend. No other anomalies in the landing gear system were noted. The cockpit landing gear 
lever, landing gear indications, and warning audio functioned properly during the test; thus, the pilot 
should have been alerted to the partial extension of the landing gear.   
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial extension of the landing gear due to the poor condition of the electric landing gear motor, 
which resulted in a gear collapse upon landing. 
Findings
Aircraft
Gear extension and retract sys - Damaged/degraded
