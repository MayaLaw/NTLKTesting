Registration:
N1268A
Aircraft:
Piper PA18

Substantial
Defining Event:
Unknown or undetermined
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, while making a right turn during a personal flight, the flight controls 
"stuck." She was unable to make aileron or elevator control inputs, and was also unable to correct the 
airplane's bank using rudder inputs. The airplane subsequently descended in a right turn until it impacted 
the ground.
The airplane was removed from the accident site before it could be examined. During recovery, both 
wings and their control cables were cut. The airplane was later examined on the pilot's property, 
strapped to a trailer. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any control 
anomalies that would have precluded normal operation; however, since the flight control system was 
compromised during the recovery, the pre-accident condition of the flight controls could not be 
determined and the investigation was unable to establish a reason for the pilot's reported loss of control.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of control while maneuvering for reasons that could not be determined based on the 
available information.
