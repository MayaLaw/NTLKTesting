Analysis 
According to the pilot, during taxi on a loose dirt surface, he initiated a left 180Â° turn. He reported that 
he was using a "fairly aggressive power setting to compensate for the surface conditions." During the 
left turn, the right wingtip struck the ground. Additionally, the propeller struck the ground, and the 
airplane then rolled left, and the left wing struck the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to left wing. 
The pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented if the airplane's power setting had not 
been more than what was needed and that "a more conservative power setting and slower taxi speed 
could prevent future occurrences."
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's taxiing too fast on rough terrain, which resulted in a loss of directional control.
