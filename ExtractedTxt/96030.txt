Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that, while taxiing after landing, he was instructed by the ground 
controller to follow a truck to transient parking. A fly-in car show event was taking place at the time, 
and several areas on the ramp were occupied by the show. With a wing walker on the right wing, he 
followed the truck and moved left of the taxiway centerline to avoid getting too close to the airplanes to 
the right that overhung into the taxiway. After the airplane was clear of the airplanes to the right, the 
pilot advanced the throttle and the left wing impacted a light pole, which resulted in substantial damage 
to the left wing. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would 
have precluded normal operation of the airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a light pole while taxiing.
