Analysis 
According to the pilot of the single-engine airplane, shortly after takeoff and about 500 ft above ground 
level, the engine lost power. He reported that he attempted to restart the engine but was unsuccessful. 
The pilot made a forced landing in a hay field; the airplane landed hard and struck a telephone pole. 
The pilot reported to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) that he 
did not preflight the airplane or check the fuel level before departure and that there should have been 
fuel in the tanks from the last flight in June 2016, 3 months before the accident. 
The pilot reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Investigator-In-Charge (IIC) 
who received the initial notification that "he ran the airplane out of gas." He further reported that there 
were no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have prevented 
normal operation.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings. 
The NTSB IIC attempted to contact the pilot on multiple occasions but was informed by the FAA ASI 
that the pilot was out of the country for the winter.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection and failure to assess the airplane's fuel quantity before 
departure, which resulted in fuel exhaustion.
