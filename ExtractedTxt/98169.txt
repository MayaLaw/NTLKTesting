Analysis 
The student pilot reported that he completed a touch-and-go landing and applied full power to increase 
the airplane's ground speed. During the takeoff roll, the engine power increased, and the airplane drifted 
to the left side of the runway. The student applied full right rudder, but it was ineffective. He then 
reduced the engine power to idle and applied brakes, but the airplane exited the left side of the runway, 
collided with a drainage culvert, and then came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing lift strut, the vertical stabilizer, and the 
rudder. 
The student reported that he thought that a mechanical malfunction of the rudder system might have 
occurred before the accident sequence. However, Federal Aviation Administration aviation safety 
inspectors reported that, during a postaccident airplane examination, the rudder system was operational, 
and rudder control continuity was established.
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff roll.
