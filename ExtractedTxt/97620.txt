Defining Event:
Flight control sys malf/fail
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Banner tow
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was performing a banner-tow flight. A ground crewmember who witnessed the 
accident stated that the airplane was operating too low during the banner pickup. That witness and 
another indicated that, when the airplane picked up the banner-tow rope, it became entangled in the area 
of the left horizontal stabilizer and elevator. The pilot radioed that he was unable to release the banner 
rope and could not turn the airplane. The airplane yawed left and only climbed to about 250 ft before 
descending into the trees by the airport.
A postaccident examination of the flight controls and the engine revealed no anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation with the exception that the banner tow rope was wrapped around the leading 
edge of the left horizontal stabilizer.
During the approach to pick up the banner, the wind was a direct left crosswind at 10 knots gusting to 14 
knots. It is likely that the pilot flew an approach that was hampered by the crosswind. During pickup of 
the tow line, the banner tow-rope became entangled with the horizontal stabilizer and elevator, reducing 
the pilot's ability to control the airplane, and resulted in a loss of control in flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of control due to the banner tow rope becoming entangled with the left horizontal 
stabilizer in&nbsp;crosswind conditions.
