Analysis 
. 
The pilot reported that, during his solo flight, he made an approach, but the airplane's airspeed was fast. 
He intended to float along the 8,000-ft-long runway, extending the distance to touchdown, because he 
wanted to exit at the taxiway near the end of the runway. During the landing flare, he misperceived the 
airplane's height above the runway because the runway was 50 ft wider than his departure airport's 
runway. He added that the airplane sank, touched down on the main landing gear, and then bounced. 
The pilot reported that he panicked and applied back pressure to the yoke, "thinking that it would 
slow...[the airplane] down." The airplane bounced several times, and he applied forward pressure to the 
yoke "to get some forward momentum to flare again," but the airplane settled on the runway. During 
taxi, the pilot felt something was wrong with the nosewheel but continued to taxi to the hangar.
The airplane sustained substantial damage the lower engine mounts.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
