Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing on a gravel airstrip, the 
airplane veered left. He started to go around, but the airplane continued left toward trees. To avoid the 
trees, he banked the airplane to the right, the right wing struck the ground, and the airplane cartwheeled 
and then came to rest on its landing gear.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing and during a subsequent attempted go-
around, which resulted in the airplane cartwheeling.
