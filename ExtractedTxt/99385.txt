Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that he simulated a power-off emergency landing with a 180ยบ turn to the 
runway and then trimmed the elevator "fully nose up" and added full flaps. Before touchdown, the 
airplane drifted right of centerline, and he had "difficulty correcting and maintaining control" of the 
airplane, so he initiated a go-around. The student added that, subsequently, he "retracted [the] flaps 
entirely," and the airplane "fell [about 10 ft] to the ground," the nosewheel impacted terrain, and the 
airplane then nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and empennage. 
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper retraction of the flaps during a go-around and his exceedance of the airplane's 
critical angle of attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
