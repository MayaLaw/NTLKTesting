Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during touchdown with the flaps extended, he 
heard the stall warning horn. Immediately following touchdown, a wind gust caused the airplane to 
balloon about 10 ft and drift left. The pilot applied power to go around; however, the airplane continued 
to drift and subsequently impacted the ground. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
At the time of the accident, the pilot was landing the airplane on runway 16 with a crosswind from 250Â° 
at 16 knots, gusting to 28 knots.
The pilot recommended less flaps and more airspeed when landing in a crosswind. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control in gusting crosswind conditions.
