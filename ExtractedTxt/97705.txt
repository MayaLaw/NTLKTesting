Substantial
Defining Event:

Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot departed in the twin-engine airplane with an estimated quantity of fuel. While landing 
at the destination airport, the airplane bounced and the pilot aborted the landing. During the subsequent 
climb, the left engine surged several times before it lost all power. The pilot attempted to restore left 
engine power by placing the auxiliary fuel pump switch to "high" and selecting "crossfeed" on the left 
fuel selector, but restoration of continuous engine power was unsuccessful.
When the left engine stopped producing power, the stall horn sounded, and the controls "started to 
buffet." The pilot said that he had "no time" to consult the emergency checklist and considered multiple 
forced landing areas before he chose to land straight ahead into trees. The airplane came to rest upright 
with substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage. There was an odor of fuel at the scene, but there 
was no evidence of fuel or fuel spillage.
Examination and testing of the engines revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation. The airplane's best single-engine rate of climb given the conditions present 
at the time of the accident was about 280 ft per minute.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight and in-flight fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion to 
the left engine and a total loss of engine power during an attempted go-around maneuver.
