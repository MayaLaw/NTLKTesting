Analysis 
The student pilot was on final approach to the destination airport during a solo flight when the engine

field, during which the airplane impacted a ditch, nosed over, and came to rest inverted. The airplane 
erupted into flames and was consumed by fire.
The postcrash fire damage precluded examination of the airplane, and the reason for the loss of engine 
power was not determined based on the available information.
