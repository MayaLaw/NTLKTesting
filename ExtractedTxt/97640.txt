Analysis 
The private pilot was landing the airplane on a 4,000-ft-long asphalt runway with a left quartering 
tailwind. He stated that the airplane started to veer to the left and that he applied the right wheel brake to 
correct for the left turn. He was unable to maintain directional control, and the airplane exited the left 
side of the runway and nosed over, which resulted in damage to the right wing. Examination of the 
airplane revealed the left wheel and tire spun freely, whereas the right wheel and brake assembly were 
tight. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or 
failures that would have precluded normal flight operations. 
Runway skid marks were consistent with the right wheel brake locking up 1,100 ft from the runway 
threshold, followed quickly by the left wheel brake locking up 1,132 ft from the runway threshold. Both 
wheel brakes were locked up until the airplane exited the runway 1,500 ft from the threshold. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's excessive use of wheel brakes while landing, which resulted in both brakes locking up, a loss 
of directional control, a runway excursion, and a nose over.
