Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing flare, a wind gust "lifted the wing up 90 degrees." She then 
leveled the wings and added full power. When the wings were leveled, the airplane was above a 
drainage ditch between the runway and parallel taxiway. She realized that the airplane would not gain 
enough airspeed to "make the [taxiway]," so she intentionally aerodynamically stalled the airplane to 
"prevent flipping" it. The airplane descended and impacted the drainage ditch.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right and left wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation system reported that the wind was from 310° at 14 knots, 
gusting to 23 knots. A weather station located about 2 miles southwest of the airport reported that, about 
the time of the accident, the wind was from 311° at 2.7 mph (about 2 knots), gusting to 12.1 mph (about 
11 knots). The pilot was landing the airplane on runway 35.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during landing in gusting crosswind 
conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
