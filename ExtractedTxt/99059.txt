Analysis 
The pilot and instructor were on final approach for landing in gusting wind conditions when, 
about 20 ft above the ground, the airplane's nose dropped and the airplane abruptly lost 20 
knots of airspeed. They initiated a go-around, but the airplane's landing gear impacted the 
runway approach lights, and the airplane subsequently impacted the runway and departed the 
right side; a postcrash fire consumed a majority of the airplane. Given the wind conditions, the 
abrupt loss of airspeed, and the subsequent loss of pitch control, it is likely that the airplane 
encountered windshear while on short final approach with insufficent altitude available to 
recover.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilotâ€™s loss of airplane control while on final approach in gusty wind conditions.
