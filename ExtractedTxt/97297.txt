Registration:
N5560W
Aircraft:
Piper PA28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Minor, 2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, on short final, the airspeed was about 65 to 70 knots with full flaps, and he 
observed the two precision approach path lights indicating two white lights. The left wing dropped, and 
he did not hear the stall warning horn. The left main landing gear touched down hard, the right main 
landing gear collapsed, and the airplane veered off the runway to the right. The pilot reported that the 
airplane hit an "air pocket" and crashed. 
A witness, located on the ramp, observed the airplane head-on coming in very low and slow. He saw the 
airplane aerodynamically stall, and the right wing drop. The right wing impacted the ground, followed 
by the right main landing gear and then the nose landing gear. The landing gear assemblies separated 
from the airplane, which skidded to an abrupt halt.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during short final, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall and hard landing.
