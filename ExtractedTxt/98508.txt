Accident Number:
ANC19CA003
Date & Time:
October 11, 2018, 12:50 Local 
Registration:
N6492H
Aircraft:
Cessna 207
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Positioning
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while on a visual approach at 700 ft, the airplane lost all engine power. The pilot 
immediately recognized that the selected fuel tank was empty because she had forgotten to switch fuel 
tanks during the flight. She attempted to restore engine power by selecting the other fuel tank, which did 
have fuel remaining, and activating the auxiliary fuel pump. Partial engine power was restored, and the 
pilot decided to land at a nearby private airstrip. During the approach, the right wing struck a tree. The 
pilot continued the landing, and during the landing roll, the nosewheel contacted soft gravel, and the 
nose landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate in-flight fuel management, which resulted in fuel starvation and the subsequent 
loss of engine power, and her subsequent failure to maintain clearance from trees during the approach to 
land at a nearby airstrip.
