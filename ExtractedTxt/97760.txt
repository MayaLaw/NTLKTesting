Analysis 
The pilot reported that he departed with 60 gallons of fuel, and about 5 hours into an aerial observation 
flight, the airplane was not responding to throttle inputs, and he decided to head toward a nearby airport 
to land. He descended to 2,000 ft, the engine experienced a total power loss, and he realized he was not 
going to be able to glide to the destination airport. He turned toward a field, and about 50 ft above 
ground, the airplane started gaining power and climbed to 100 ft. The engine experienced another power 
loss, and he turned 180Â° toward the interstate, and the engine surged a second time before losing power 
again. During the forced landing on the interstate, the airplane struck a car and came to rest in the grass 
adjacent to the road.
Video provided by the Federal Aviation Administration showed no fuel drained from the left fuel tank 
and less than 1/2 cup of fuel drained from the right fuel tank.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a subsequent total loss of 
engine power.
