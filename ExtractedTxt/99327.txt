Registration:
N29Y

Beech 50
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was returning the multiengine airplane to his home base following an annual inspection other 
maintenance; the accident flight was the airplane's first flight since the work was performed. After 
climbing to about 3,000 ft mean sea level (msl), the pilot configured the airplane for cruise flight. The 
pilot heard the right engine emit "sputtering" noises and backfire. The pilot advanced the throttle of the 
left engine and then noticed a "large smoke trail" emit from the left engine about 1 minute after the right 
engine began sputtering. The pilot concluded that the two engines were no longer producing adequate 
power to remain airborne and performed a forced landing to a tilled dirt field, during which the nose 
landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage. Signatures consistent with detonation were 
documented on the left engine Nos. 4 and 6 cylinder assemblies, and the right engine No. 2 cylinder 
assembly. Oil-covered particles were found in the oil screens from both engines; the source of these 
particles could not be determined. The reason for the detonation in both engines could not be determined 
based on the available evidence. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power on both engines due to detonation for undetermined reasons.
