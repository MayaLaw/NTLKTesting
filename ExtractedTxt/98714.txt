Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a touch-and-go landing, he applied full power to take off and, although 
the airplane departed the runway surface about 50 knots, it did not accelerate, and the airspeed 
decreased. The airplane began exhibiting characteristics consistent with a stall and he lowered the nose. 
The airplane then settled back onto the ground slightly off the left side of the runway surface and 
continued through a grassy field, a fence, and a ditch. The airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, 
resulting in substantial damage. Witnesses reported observing the airplane in a nose-high attitude before 
it descended from view. The flaps were found extended to 40° at the accident site. 
The density altitude at the time of the accident was about 7,386 ft, and there was an approximate 4-knot 
tailwind for the landing runway, which had a 1.4% upslope. According to the Federal Aviation 
Administration Airport/Facility directory, the opposite runway was recommended for touch-and-go 
landings in tailwind conditions up to 5 knots. 
According to the manufacturer's takeoff performance chart, there was adequate runway available for 
takeoff; however, given the high-density altitude, the tailwind, and the runway upslope, the distance 
required to conduct a touch-and-go landing and takeoff distance were significantly increased, which 
resulted in the airplane’s inability to become airborne within the remaining runway.
