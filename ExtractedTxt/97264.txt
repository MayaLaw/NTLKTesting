Analysis 
According to the pilot in the retractable-landing gear-equipped airplane, he set up for an extended final 
approach to the sandy turf runway. He waited until he cleared the trees and "thenâ€¦dropped down to 
land." The main landing gear touched down first, followed by the nose landing gear. The main and nose 
landing gear collapsed upon contact with the runway. The pilot reported that the airplane slid about 300 
ft before it came to a stop on the right side of the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the lower fuselage. 
The Federal Aviation Administration aviation safety inspector who examined the airplane at the accident 
site reported that witnesses stated that the pilot landed the airplane hard on the sandy turf surface. 
However, the pilot stated that he did not. However, the pilot did state that he really had to bring the 
airplane in steep over the trees to get it on the runway. 
Photographs provided by the operator showed vertical deformation of both wings at the main landing 
gear mount location.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's steep approach, which resulted in a hard landing and the collapse of the landing gear during 
touchdown.
