Loss of engine power (partial)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot and pilot rated passenger were conducting a local flight when the engine began to run 
roughly, and partial loss of engine power followed. The airplane was unable to maintain 
altitude, and the pilot made a forced landing onto a muddy road. During the landing roll, the 
airplane sunk in the mud, nosed over, and came to rest inverted, causing substantial damage to 
the left wing and vertical stabilizer.  An engine examination and test run were performed, 
which revealed no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded 
normal operation. 
The nearest weather reporting facility, located about 6 nautical miles from the accident site, 
reported a temperature of 35.6oF and a dew point of 19.4oF, which was in the range of 
atmosphere conditions that are conducive to carburetor icing at glide and cruise power 
settings. The pilot reported that the carburetor heat was not activated at the time of the partial 
loss of engine power.
The pilot also reported that he was in the rear airplane seat. Although the pilot had access to 
both sets of flight controls, the rear seat compartment was not equipped with a carburetor heat 
control handle. Engine power would likely have been restored if the carburetor heat had been 
engaged.
