Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while departing on a cross-country flight from the 2,738-ft-long runway, the 
engine lost partial power about 100 ft above ground level during the initial climb. He lowered the 
airplane's nose, which appeared to restore engine power, then raised the nose again as the airplane 
approached the end of the runway. The engine then experienced a "severe" loss of power and the 
airplane subsequently impacted a dirt field at the departure end of the runway. Postaccident examination 
of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation, and review of data from the onboard engine monitor revealed that the engine was producing 
full power throughout the takeoff. 
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector spoke to several witnesses who saw the pilot fill a truck 
bed with belongings from the accident airplane, including wooden crates full of avocados. The pilot 
confirmed that he had a "substantial amount" of cargo on board, and that he did not calculate the 
airplane's weight and balance for the flight.
Based on the available information, it is likely that the pilot's inadequate preflight planning resulted in 
his exceedance of the airplane's maximum gross weight, which lead to the the airplane's poor climb 
performance, the perceived loss of engine power, and the subsequent loss of control and impact with 
terrain.
