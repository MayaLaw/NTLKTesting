Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Sacramento, California
Accident Number:
WPR17LA210
Date & Time:
September 20, 2017, 13:14 Local 
Registration:
N7330E
Aircraft:
Cessna 210
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane was occupied by its new owner, a private pilot, and a flight instructor; they had just 
completed a personal flight. During the landing roll, the main landing gear partially collapsed and the 
airplane departed the runway surface, resulting in substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer. 
Both pilots gave conflicting statements regarding their roles during the flight but agreed that the landing 
gear was extended during the landing approach.
Postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies with the landing gear system that would have 
precluded normal operation, and the gear was successfully extended and retracted multiple times using 
the gear handle during the examination; therefore, the reason for the partial gear collapse could not be 
determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Partial retraction of the main landing gear during the landing roll for reasons that could not be 
determined because postaccident examination and functional testing of the gear revealed no anomalies.
