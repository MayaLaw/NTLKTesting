Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
After completing an uneventful preflight inspection, the pilot was unable to start the engine due to low 
pressure in the pneumatic system. An individual arrived with a tank of air to pressurize the system while 
the pilot remained in the airplane. The pilot shut off the compressed air supply valve, as required during 
a pneumatic system recharge; however, the recharge could not be accomplished due to an incorrect 
adapter. While the individual left to find the correct adapter, another individual offered to help start the 
engine manually by turning the propeller. After the engine started, the pilot forgot to reopen the 
compressed air supply valve and, during taxi, the airplane experienced a loss of braking performance 
that affected its steering capabilities (the steering is accomplished through differential braking, and the 
brake system requires pneumatic pressure to operate). The pilot was unable to maintain directional 
control, and the airplane subsequently collided with a fence and sustained substantial damage to the left 
wing.
The checklist for the make/model airplane does not require the pilot to check the air pressure or valve 
position during the preflight, engine start, or before takeoff phases.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during taxi after a reduction in braking performance 
and steering capabilities due to his failure to reopen the air supply valve after the nonstandard engine 
start.
