Analysis 
The pilot departed on a postmaintenance check flight after an annual inspection on the previous day. 
According to the pilot, the airplane was flown in the local traffic pattern before departing the area. As 
the airplane climbed through 2,500 ft, it was not climbing more than 300 ft per minute without losing 
airspeed, and the pilot noticed a decrease in engine rpm. The pilot indicated that the oil pressure and oil 
temperature were normal, the vacuum gauge indicated "zero," and gyroscopic instruments began to drift 
and tumble. The pilot proceeded directly for the nearest airport, and when on final approach for the 
runway, the engine rpm and airspeed decreased. The engine did not respond to throttle inputs, and the 
pilot landed the airplane on a river levy. The airplane bounced, contacted a road, and came to rest 
against the airport perimeter fence, which resulted in substantial damage to both wings. Examination of 
the engine revealed that the output shaft of the vacuum pump was sheared. It could not be determined if 
the vacuum pump output shaft failed before or during the accident sequence. Additional engine 
information was not available. The reason for the partial loss of engine power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
evidence.
