Analysis 
The pilot reported that he planned to land close to the numbers, but when the airplane was about 15 ft 
above ground level, it descended unexpectedly. He added power and pitched the airplane nose down, 
and the nosewheel touched down hard. The airplane began to porpoise, so he increased the throttle to 
full, but the airplane veered left, exited the runway, and impacted an empty hangar. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
