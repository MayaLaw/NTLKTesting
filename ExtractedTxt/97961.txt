Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
White Mountain, Alaska
Accident Number:
ANC18LA059
Date & Time:
July 31, 2018, 23:00 Local 
Registration:
N185KB
Aircraft:
Cessna A185F
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a cross-country flight when he demonstrated a momentary 
zero-G maneuver, shortly after which the engine lost partial power. The pilot was unable to 
restore engine power and subsequently conducted a forced landing to tundra covered terrain, 
during which the airplane nosed over, resulting in substantial damage. 
Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation; however, one engine exhaust valve exhibited signatures 
consistent with uneven excessive heat exposure, but no mechanical failure of the valve, 
therefore would not have resulted in a loss of power. It is unlikely that a momentary zero G 
maneuver would result in a partial power loss that could not be restored.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident 
examination of the engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded 
normal operation.
