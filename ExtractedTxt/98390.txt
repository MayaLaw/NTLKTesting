Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while on step during takeoff from an ocean bay and as she turned the float-
equipped airplane into the wind, the left wing and float raised. The right wing impacted the water, and 
the airplane pivoted about 90° clockwise before coming to rest partially submerged on its left side. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
A video of the takeoff taken from the shore showed the airplane making a sweeping left turn on the step. 
Wind indications in the video showed the wind coming from the airplane's left. The left turn tightens as 
the airplane turns into the wind, the left wing and float lift, and the right wing then strikes the water.
The automated weather observation system about 4 nautical miles from the accident site reported that, 
about the time of the accident, the wind was from 330° at 8 knots. The pilot was departing to the 
northwest.
The pilot reported that the wind at the accident site was light and variable at 0 to 5 knots. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain lateral control of the airplane during a step-turn takeoff.
