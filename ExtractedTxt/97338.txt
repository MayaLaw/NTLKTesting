Analysis 
According to the student pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, he had completed a cross-country 
flight and aborted the first landing due to crosswind gusts from the left. He also aborted the second 
landing, but on his third approach about 60 knots, he committed to the landing. Just before touching 
down, the airplane encountered a left crosswind gust and then touched down oriented 10° left of the 
runway heading and bounced. The airplane veered right and exited the right side of the runway. He 
added full power and aborted the landing, but the airspeed was too slow. The airplane remained airborne 
for 150 ft, landed in a dirt field, and nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and windscreen.
The student reported that, at the time of the accident, "winds were out of the NW at approximately 11 
mph (as indicated by my Garmin Pilot app) with a 6 mph crosswind from the West and gusting." The 
airplane landed on runway 31.
The nearest METAR, which was 6 miles southwest of the accident site, reported that, about the time of 
the accident, the wind was from 300° at 10 knots. 
The student reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
