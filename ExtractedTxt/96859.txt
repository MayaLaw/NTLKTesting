Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, during the preflight, he and the pilot-rated passenger, who was not a 
flight instructor, inspected the fuel sumps on each wing and the engine, "pulling [a] sample on each." He 
added that, during departure from the airstrip, after they became airborne for about 9 seconds, the engine 
rpm dropped to idle. The propeller was still rotating, but the airplane's engine was not producing power. 
Subsequently, the airplane landed in a cotton field, the nose landing gear sheared off, and the airplane 
came to rest nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the tail and fuselage.
The student pilot reported that the airplane had gone through a pre-purchase inspection the previous 
week, and the airplane had accrued little time since the annual, which was 7 months before the accident 
flight. He added that it seemed like the airplane was starved for fuel.
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported finding substantial water in the gascolator.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to detect water in the fuel system during the preflight inspection, which resulted in a 
loss of engine power during departure and a subsequent impact with terrain.
