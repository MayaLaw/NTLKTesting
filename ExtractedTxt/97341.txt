The pilot reported that, during landing in gusting crosswind conditions, the airplane hit the runway

and landed without further incident.
Postaccident examination revealed that the airplane had sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
