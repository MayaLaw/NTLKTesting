Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, upon landing, the airplane bounced twice and 
started to veer left. He immediately applied power to go around, but the main landing gear struck a 
snowbank, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left and right wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing and loss of directional control 
and the airplane's subsequent impact with a snowbank and nose-over during an attempted go-around.
