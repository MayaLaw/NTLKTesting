Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During the landing roll, the pilot applied left rudder and lightly depressed the brake handle to exit the 
runway. About 30Â° into the left turn, the brakes failed, and the airplane exited the asphalt taxiway 
surface. Due to obstructions ahead and the downsloping terrain, the pilot applied right rudder and engine 
power to realign the airplane with the runway. Shortly thereafter, the airplane overran the departure end 
of the runway and traveled downslope while airborne. The airplane then touched down and impacted a 
dirt berm before it collided with a fence, nosed over, and came to rest inverted, sustaining substantial 
damage to the fuselage and both wings. Examination of the airplane revealed that the brake control cable 
was fractured near the cable thimble and was separated from the brake control handle. The fracture 
surfaces of the separated cable were consistent with a fatigue fracture. Six of the seven strands of wires 
exhibited relatively flat fracture surfaces normally oriented to the wire axis, consistent with a 
progressive fracture mechanism, such as a fatigue fracture. Only one strand and a few of the remaining 
individual wires showed evidence of minor elongation at the fracture location. It is likely that the cable 
completely failed during the landing roll when the pilot depressed the brake handle.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of brake control due to fatigue fracture of the brake control cable, which resulted in the separation 
of the cable from the brake handle.
