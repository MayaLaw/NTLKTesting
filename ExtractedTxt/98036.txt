Accident Number:
ANC18LA064
Date & Time:
August 7, 2018, 12:15 Local 
Registration:
N7379U
Aircraft:
Cessna 207
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air taxi & commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
The pilot reported that shortly after takeoff, as he began to configure the airplane for cruise flight, the 
engine began to run rough and lose power, and he elected to immediately return to the airport. The 
engine subsequently lost total power and the pilot performed a forced landing on tundra-covered terrain, 
during which the airplane sustained substantial damage. 
Examination revealed that the No. 2 piston was eroded on the bottom side, and a hole was burned 
through. The No. 2 piston and cylinder head were mechanically damaged by loose piston ring debris. 
Closer examination of the No. 2 cylinder head revealed re-solidified molten metal around the bottom 
Heli-Coil tang notch. All damage discovered was consistent with a pre-ignition/detonation event; 
however, the cause of the pre-ignition and/or detonation could not be determined based on the available 
information.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to detonation/preignition damage of the No. 2 cylinder and piston for 
reasons that could not be determined.
