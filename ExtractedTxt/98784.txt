Registration:
N41VK
Aircraft:
Beech A36
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that during taxi after landing on a 2,550-ft-long asphalt runway, he intended to retract 
the flaps, but accidently retracted the landing gear, resulting in the nose gear and right main landing gear 
collapsing on the runway. The pilot added that that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions 
with the airplane.
Examination of the accident site revealed runway scrape marks and propeller strikes originating about 
1,000 ft beyond the approach end of the runway. The marks extended about 500 ft and terminated at the 
wreckage, off the left side of the runway. The left main landing gear remained extended and the right 
wing and lower fuselage sustained damage. The length of scrape marks and extent of damage were 
consistent with a landing gear collapse during a high-speed landing rollout, rather than a low-speed taxi 
after landing. The airplane was equipped with a squat switch on both main landing gear to prevent 
inadvertent landing gear retraction on the ground; however, the switch required weight-on-wheels to 
work effectively. It's likely that the pilot bounced the landing and attempted to retract the flaps in an 
effort to settle the airplane on the runway for better wheel braking; however, without weight on the right 
main landing gear, the gear retracted when the pilot inadvertently moved the landing gear lever instead 
of the flap lever.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilotâ€™s inadvertent retraction of the landing gear during landing rollout, resulting in a 
landing gear collapse.
