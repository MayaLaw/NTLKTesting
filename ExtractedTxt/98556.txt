Analysis 
The pilot in the experimental, amateur-built airplane reported that, about 5 minutes after takeoff, he felt 
air coming into the cockpit from the canopy. He noticed that the canopy latch was not adequately 
secured and attempted to secure it, but the canopy opened. The airplane became very difficult to control 
with the canopy open, so he made an emergency landing in a cornfield. During landing, the nosewheel 
collapsed, and the airplane skidded to a stop.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to secure the canopy latch before takeoff, which resulted in the canopy opening in 
flight and the subsequent loss of airplane control.
