Analysis 
The pilot of the ski-equipped airplane reported that, while on approach to a snow-covered airstrip, there 
was a quartering right gusting crosswind. He added that, about 100 ft above the ground, the right wing 
rose, and he attempted to correct to no avail. He added that the airplane was about 90° off of course to 
the left, and he chose to go between two trees. Subsequently, the left wing impacted a tree and separated 
from the airplane, and the airplane came to rest nose down.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system about 9 nautical miles from the accident site reported that, 
about the time of the accident, the wind was from 280° at 12 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The pilot landed 
on runway 26.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain the runway heading during the approach in gusting crosswind conditions.
