Analysis 
The pilot was landing the airplane in gusty wind conditions when he lost directional control of the 
airplane. After touchdown, the airplane veered off the runway to the left, despite the pilot’s corrective 
inputs. Subsequently, the airplane exited the runway, struck two runway signs, and spun to the right 
before coming to a stop.
An examination of the airplane revealed that the nosewheel would not center and that it pointed to the 
right. Impact damage was visible on the nosewheel strut assembly. Additionally, when the right rudder 
pedal was pushed to the full position, the right rudder was about 5° from full deflection. It could not be 
determined whether these anomalies were impact related. The airplane would have had right turning 
tendencies if the nosewheel condition existed during the landing. The pilot would have had less rudder 
authority available to counter the left turning tendencies if the rudder condition existed during landing. 
No other mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation were 
observed. 
The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot’s inability to maintain directional control 
during landing in strong, gusty wind conditions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s inability to maintain directional control during landing in gusty crosswind conditions for 
reasons that could not be determined based on available evidence.
