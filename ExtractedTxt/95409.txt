Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing flare, the airplane encountered a "sudden massive gust of 
wind" that pitched the nose up. He pushed the yoke forward, but the wind shifted to a tailwind, and the 
airplane "slammed" onto the runway. Subsequently, the left main landing gear collapsed, the airplane 
veered right off the runway, and it then came to rest nose down.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 260Â° at 4 knots. The pilot landed on runway 26. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing and a subsequent loss of directional 
control.
