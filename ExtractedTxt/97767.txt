The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing roll on a soft-field

The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left and right wing lift struts.  
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
