Analysis 
The pilot reported that, shortly after departure, about 1,000 ft above ground level, the engine lost total 
power. While searching for an off-airport landing spot, he made a right turn toward the airport, 
positioned the fuel selector knob toward the second tank, and attempted to restart the engine. The engine 
restarted briefly but then lost power. He attempted to restart the engine again after he repositioned the 
fuel selector back to the original tank, but the engine did not start. He conducted a forced landing in a 
field with trees and heavy vegetation 2 miles west of the airport. 
The pilot added that he "should have made a positive determination of fuel on board prior to takeoff." 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage.
Postaccident examination by the Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed no distinctive fuel 
odor at the accident site, and only a cup of fuel was recovered from both tanks. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection of the fuel, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a 
subsequent total loss of engine power.
