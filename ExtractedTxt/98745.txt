Analysis 
The pilot was flying the airplane to a nearby airport to obtain fuel. Before departing on the 
flight, he checked the fuel quantity using the onboard fuel totalizer and determined that both 
fuel gauges indicated adequate fuel for the intended flight. During the landing approach at the 
destination, the engine lost total power and the airplane impacted terrain short of the runway. 
The pilot reported that the loss of power was due to fuel starvation. A witness at the airport 
reported that the airplane made a "very sharp left-banking turn" as it flew overhead, then 
climbed steeply and made another sharp left turn to enter the traffic pattern for landing.
Examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies with the flight control system that would 
have prevented normal operation. No evidence of fuel was found in the engine-driven fuel 
pump filter; the filter was clean. There was no evidence of fuel in the lines between the engine-
driven pump and engine gas producer. Before recovery from the accident site, less than 1 gallon 
of fuel was drained from the left wing tanks and less than 4 gallons of fuel was drained from 
the right wing fuel tanks.
The pilot’s operating handbook for the airplane stated that, when the fuel tanks were 1/4-full or 
less, prolonged uncoordinated flight, such as slips or skids, could uncover the fuel tank outlets, 
causing fuel starvation and engine stoppage. It is likely that given the airplane’s low fuel state, 
the abrupt maneuvers caused the fuel outlets to become uncovered, resulting in fuel starvation 
to the engine and a total loss of engine power.
