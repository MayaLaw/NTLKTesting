Analysis 
The commercial pilot was conducting an aerial application flight. He stated that while maneuvering at 
1,500 ft, he heard a "deep knock" in the engine; the entire windshield became covered with oil, and the 
engine lost power. The pilot made a forced landing to a service road, during which the airplane struck a 
barbed-wire fence with the right wings before coming to rest in a field. Postaccident examination of the 
engine revealed the No. 2 cylinder had separated from the cylinder mounting deck. Two fractured 
sections of the left crankcase that included part of the No. 2 cylinder bore were found in the engine 
cowling. All but one of the No. 2 cylinder base studs and through bolts remained in the cylinder bore 
and were fractured. The fractured surfaces exhibited signatures consistent with fatigue. The fatigue 
failure of the No. 2 cylinder studs and through bolts and the fracture of the crankcase led to the loss of 
engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Fatigue failure of the No. 2 cylinder studs/through bolts and the fracture of the crankcase, which resulted 
in a total loss of engine power.
