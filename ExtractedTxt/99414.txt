Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he made a three-point landing, but during the 
landing roll, the airplane veered right. He added that his left rudder and brake application "was not fast 
enough to arrest the progressive turn rate." He then applied full power to regain directional control, but 
his corrective action was too slow, so he decided to go around. He then realized that the climb rate was 
too slow, so he decided to abort the takeoff. The airplane touched down and exited the right side of the 
runway and subsequently ground looped to the right, and the left wing struck the ground
The left wing sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing, which resulted in a ground loop.
