Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after an agricultural application flight, during the landing roll in a rain shower 
and with a crosswind, the tailwheel-equipped airplane hit a "bump" and became airborne. He added that 
the airplane was slow, drifted left, and touched down hard. Subsequently, the airplane exited the runway 
and ground looped. The pilot reported that he should have landed farther down the runway to avoid the 
bumps that caused the airplane to become airborne.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
An automated weather observation system located about 19 nautical miles from the accident site 
reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 260Â° at 12 knots. The pilot landed the 
airplane on runway 18.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for landing in crosswind conditions, which resulted in the 
airplane inadvertently becoming airborne and a subsequent hard landing and loss of directional control.
