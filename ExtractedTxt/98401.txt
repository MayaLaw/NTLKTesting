Analysis 
The noninstructor-rated pilot reported that he agreed to go flying with a student pilot in the student's 
airplane and act as pilot-in-command while seated in the right seat. During the approach to land with the 
student on the controls, the airplane was high, but with the "airfield made," the student selected full 
flaps. According to the pilot, the airplane "got slow and low," and the student initiated a go-around, 
during which, in a single motion, the pilot raised the flaps to the full-up position, and the airplane 
"struggled to fly and climb." Subsequently, the airplane impacted trees at the end of the runway and 
came to rest on its right side. 
The pilot added that the Pilot's Operating Handbook states that the flaps should be retracted one notch at 
a time.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the empennage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper retraction of the flaps during a go-around, which resulted in the airplane's failure to 
climb and its subsequent collision with trees.
