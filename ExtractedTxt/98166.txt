Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Rushville, Indiana
Accident Number:
CEN18LA352
Date & Time:
August 27, 2018, 13:50 Local 
Registration:
N4379L
Aircraft:
Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot indicated that, during the cross-country flight, the engine "sputtered" several times then 
regained power. During the descent, it sputtered again and then lost power. The pilot reported she did 
not believe she was experiencing carburetor icing conditions during the cruise portion of the flight and 
did not remember what temperature the carburetor temperature gauge was displaying at the time. During 
the descent, the pilot attempted to troubleshoot the engine power loss without applying carburetor heat 
but was not successful in regaining engine power. During the forced landing, she attempted to maneuver 
the airplane between a power line pole and several trees. The airplane struck the power lines and 
impacted a field in a slightly nose-down attitude, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and 
fuselage.
Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures 
that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane had adequate fuel on board to complete the 
flight. The weather conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to serious carburetor icing at 
glide power settings. The loss of engine power likely occurred due to carburetor icing and the pilot's 
failure to apply carburetor heat in conditions conducive to carburetor icing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of engine power due to carburetor icing and the pilot's failure to use carburetor heat in weather 
conditions conducive to carburetor icing.
