Analysis 
The pilot-rated owner reported that he was allowing another pilot to build time in his airplane to qualify 
for the airplane's insurance. During the accident flight, the pilot occupied the left seat, and the owner 
occupied the right seat. During takeoff after a touch-and-go landing, the pilot rotated a bit early, and the 
airplane settled back onto the runway. He aborted the takeoff, applied heavy braking, and the airplane 
fishtailed and then veered left. The owner took the flight controls, but the airplane exited left of the 
runway and impacted a ditch.
The pilot reported that, during the familiarization flight to practice touch-and-go landings, on the second 
takeoff, he aborted the takeoff because he realized that he did not have enough runway available. He 
applied heavy braking, and the airplane veered left into a swamp.
The owner added that he was sitting in the right seat and that the right seat position does not have 
brakes. He believed that his "inexperience at controlling the airplane from the right seat" also 
contributed to the accident.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The owner reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
