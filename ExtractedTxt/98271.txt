Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot and five passengers departed on a personal night cross-country flight. According 
to the pilot, the engine start and run-up were uneventful. Shortly after takeoff, the engine lost total 
power, and the pilot was unable to maintain altitude. He conducted a forced landing, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the fuselage and wings. 
An engine examination revealed that the upper right spark plugs were in a worn-out normal condition 
and the lower spark plugs were in a worn-out severe condition. The lower spark plugs were replaced, 
and a test engine run was conducted; the engine started and ran without hesitation at various power 
settings. However, it was noted during the test that the engine would not run on the right magneto. 
Further examination of the right magneto found a failed magneto coil. Despite the failed coil on the right 
magneto and the spark plug condition, the engine ran at full power settings. No other anomalies were 
noted with the engine or fuel system that would have precluded normal operation. A failed magneto or 
the noted spark plug conditions would have resulted in a rough-running engine but not a complete loss 
of engine power as the pilot described. Thus, the reason for the total loss of power could not be 
determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available evidence.
