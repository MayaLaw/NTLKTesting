Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, the wind caused the airplane's left wing to rise and that 
the airplane then veered right. He attempted to correct with aileron and rudder pedals, but the airplane 
exited the runway to the right. He added that the nose landing gear tire "went into the grass," and the 
airplane came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the vertical stabilizer.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about 5 minutes after the accident, the 
wind was from 220Â° at 15 knots, gusting to 22 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 27.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in gusting crosswind conditions, 
which resulted in a runway excursion and nose-over.
