Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, during landing, shortly after touchdown, a "crosswind…lifted the left 
wing," and the airplane "fishtailed." He said he and the instructor corrected by applying right aileron, but 
the airplane ground looped, and the right main landing gear collapsed. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the lower right section of the fuselage. 
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about 30 minutes before the accident, 
the wind was from 130° at 8 knots and that, about 15 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 100º 
at 9 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 16R.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing in a left quartering headwind, 
which resulted in a ground loop.
