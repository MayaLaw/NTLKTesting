Analysis 
The pilot departed on the 300-nautical mile, 3-hour cross-country flight with 5 Â½ hours of fuel 
onboard. About 7 miles from the destination airport at an altitude of 1,000 ft mean sea level, 
the engine sputtered, then lost total power. The propeller continued to windmill as the pilot 
attempted to troubleshoot and restart the engine utilizing the fuel boost pump, but he was 
unsuccessful. The pilot performed a forced landing into the ocean about 100 yards from shore, 
and then extricated himself and was rescued.
The airplane remained submerged in the ocean for 18 hours before it was recovered. During 
recovery, 5 gallons of aviation fuel was removed from the fuel tanks. The engine and 
components were corroded due to the saltwater immersion, which precluded testing of the 
engine. The reported weather conditions were not conducive to the development of carburetor 
icing. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined based on the available 
information.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information.
