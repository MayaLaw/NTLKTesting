Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during the takeoff roll, the pilot's side window blew open as full 
power was applied. He added that he "reached over with [his] right hand to close [the] window," but as 
he did so, the airplane veered off the runway to the left into a wooded area and impacted terrain. The 
student pilot reported that he had noticed on previous flights that the window latch was loose and that he 
had planned to get it fixed but had not done so.
Both wings sustained substantial damage.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's decision to attempt to close the cockpit window during takeoff and his subsequent 
failure to maintain directional control.
