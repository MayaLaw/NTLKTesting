Analysis 
The pilot of the airplane reported that, during landing, she added full flaps, and the wind shifted. She 
applied full power, but the airplane settled, and the left main landing gear touched down on the left edge 
of the runway. Subsequently, the airplane impacted trees on the left side of the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind was light and variable and that she landed on runway 19. The automated 
weather observation system about 9 nautical miles from the accident site reported that, about the time of 
the accident, the wind was from 220Â° at 7 knots. Additional weather observations from the same site 
showed that, from 1 hour before the accident until 1 hour after the accident, the wind direction varied 
from south-southwest to west-northwest, and the speed varied from 6 to 8 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper landing flare in variable wind conditions, which resulted in the 
airplane landing on the left edge of the runway and impacting trees.
