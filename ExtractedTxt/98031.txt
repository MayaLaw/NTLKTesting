Analysis 
The airline transport pilot reported that during the landing roll on the grass/dirt runway after a cross-
country flight, he applied the wheel brakes, and the airplane immediately veered to the left. Despite the 
application of brakes and rudder control, the pilot was unable to regain directional control as the airplane 
travelled off the left side of the runway, over a water sprinkler system, and through a fence before 
coming to rest. 
The pilot reported that the left brake line had been breached during the accident sequence. The line was 
replaced, and testing of the left brake revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. 
Postaccident examination of the airport's runway found it to be in good condition with no holes or 
defects that would prevent a normal landing. Thus, it is likely that the pilot failed to maintain directional 
control during the landing roll.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.
