Analysis 
The student pilot was on the first leg of a solo cross-country flight. A witness at the destination 
airport reported that he heard loud “engine noise,” looked up, and then saw the airplane about 
midfield in a steep, left descending turn with the “nose about 40° down.” The airplane then 
descended out of his view behind a hangar, and shortly thereafter, he heard the sound of 
impact. Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane had struck a power line 
about 700 ft left of the runway centerline at midfield, impacted terrain and three different 
sections of fencing, and then came to rest nose down. 
During postaccident examination of the airplane, the throttle control was found in the full-
forward position, and the pitch trim was found in a slightly nose-down position. Postaccident 
examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
According to the flight school owner, a flight school policy prohibited students from conducting 
touch-and-go landings on solo cross-country flights. Given this policy and the postaccident 
throttle position, it is likely that the student was conducting a go-around and that he lost 
airplane control during the initial climb.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot’s loss of airplane control during a go-around.
