Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, several minutes after takeoff for the personal flight, he maneuvered the 
airplane to enter the traffic pattern to practice touch-and-go landings. Shortly after, he noticed a fire near 
the rudder pedals. He expedited his approach, and the fire continued to grow while he landed the 
airplane. After landing, he safely egressed from the airplane; a few seconds later, the cockpit area was 
engulfed in flames. The airplane was destroyed.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed evidence of a fuel-fed fire that had emanated from the 
rear, lower center portion of the engine. Extensive thermal damage was in the area where the mechanical 
fuel pump is mounted to the oil cooler. The oil cooler's bottom hose connection was separated from the 
oil cooler, and the fuel pump's bottom portion was missing. Due to the fire damage, the exact initiation 
point and source of the fire could not be determined.
There were no maintenance write-ups indicating a fuel leak or odors in the previous 20 flight hours.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An in-flight fuel-fed fire from an unknown source for reasons that could not be determined due to the 
extensive fire damage to the airplane.
