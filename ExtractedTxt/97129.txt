Analysis 
The pilot departed the private agricultural airstrip to the south, orbited over the area just west of 
the airstrip, then proceeded east. Just east of the airstrip, the pilot turned left heading north then 
made a 180Â° left turn back toward the south and onto a right downwind in preparation to land to 
the north. The pilot stated that about midway down and parallel to the runway, the engine surged 
about two to three times then completely lost power. The pilot elected to perform a forced 
landing in a plowed field, but during a short landing roll, the airplane nosed over on its back, 
which resulted in substantial damage to both upper wing panels, both horizontal stabilizers, the 
rudder, and the elevator. 
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed damage consistent with an engine that was not 
producing power at the time of impact. 
Functional tests of the fuel control unit identified fuel schedules that were out of specification 
limits, and operation of the engine at low power conditions with the out-of-specification fuel 
control settings most likely resulted in unstable engine operation below 100% engine speed. The 
fuel shutoff valve (FSOV), which terminates fuel flow to the engine, was found in the 
electrically commanded closed position after removal from the airplane. Testing of the valve 
indicated that it required a higher voltage to open than specified, and had a higher leakage 
through the output port than was specified, but it passed all other tests and neither condition 
would cause an uncommanded closing of the valve. 
The results of the engine teardown examination coupled with the functional testing of various 
engine components failed to reveal what precipitated the reported engine surge condition before 
the subsequent loss of engine power.
