Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airline transport pilot reported that, during the landing roll, the experimental, amateur-built airplane 
started drifting to the left and he applied right rudder to correct. He subsequently attempted to apply 
right brake pressure to further correct for the drift as the airplane was traveling about 50 knots. At that 
time, the right brake pedal "went to the floor," and there was "zero" right brake available. The airplane 
departed the left side of the runway, crossed the grass, and came to rest on the parallel taxiway.
A postrecovery examination revealed that the plastic right brake line was broken near the upper end of 
the landing gear strut. The airplane was equipped with a free-castering nosewheel and did not have any 
nosewheel steering capability. Directional control during ground operations was maintained with 
differential braking. As a result, maintaining directional control after the brake failure was not possible.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the right brake line, which resulted in a loss of directional control and runway excursion.
