Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a personal cross-country flight and decided to stop at an intermediate 
airport to refuel the airplane. When the airplane touched down, it swerved left, exited the side of the 
runway, struck a runway edge light, and then nosed over in soft terrain. 
Examination of the runway revealed that a long black line, which extended from the centerline to where 
the runway edge light was struck, was imprinted in the pavement. It is likely that the imprint was created 
by the chine that was pronounced on both sides of the tire. These ground signatures indicate that the 
nosewheel tire was likely flat upon touchdown, which led to the pilot’s inability to maintain directional 
control upon landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A flat nosewheel tire, which resulted in the pilot’s inability to maintain directional control on landing.
