Registration:
N70252
Aircraft:
Cessna E162
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The sport pilot reported that, while conducting a personal, cross-country flight and while nearing the 
destination airport, he reduced the engine rpm from 2,350 to 2,200 and began a slow descent from a 
cruise altitude of 3,500 ft mean sea level (msl) to a traffic pattern altitude of 2,800 ft msl. He added that 
the carburetor heat was not on at that time, and that, about 2 minutes later, he noticed that the engine had 
lost all power without any roughness or sputtering. The pilot turned on the carburetor heat, positioned 
the mixture to full rich, and confirmed that the fuel shutoff valve was not engaged; however, the engine 
did not respond, so he subsequently conducted a forced landing to a field, during which the right wing 
struck a fence, and the airplane came to rest inverted.
 
Postaccident examination of the airplane and the engine revealed no evidence of any preaccident 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation, and the engine was 
successfully test run. The atmospheric conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to serious 
carburetor icing at cruise power, and the Pilot's Operating Handbook Descent Checklist instructed pilots 
to apply carburetor heat, as required, during descent. Therefore, it is likely that carburetor ice 
accumulated during cruise flight and that the pilot applied the carburetor heat too late to melt the ice, 
which resulted in the loss of engine power. The pilot stated that he did not fully understand the 
potentially subtle nature of carburetor ice.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delay in applying carburetor heat, which resulted in a total loss of engine power 
during descent due to carburetor icing.
