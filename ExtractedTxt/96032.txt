Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that he and the pilot-rated passenger returned to the airport to practice 
touch-and-go landings after a local flight. The first two landings were uneventful. While on the 
downwind leg of the traffic pattern for the third landing, the pilot reduced engine power and started to 
descend the airplane. After turning base, the pilot increased power, but the engine did not respond and 
remained at idle. There was no change in engine noise and the engine was not running rough. The pilot 
manipulated the throttle and primer several times, but the engine did not respond, and the pilot elected to 
land the airplane on a nearby road. During the descent, the airplane struck powerlines and a tree before it 
impacted the road and slid to a stop.
A postaccident engine examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. A review of the carburetor icing probability chart revealed that the airplane was operating in 
conditions favorable to the formation of serious carburetor icing at glide power. In addition, on-scene 
photographs revealed that the carburetor heat lever was in the off position; therefore, it is likely that 
carburetor ice accumulated during the descent, which resulted in a partial loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power due to the formation of carburetor ice during descent for landing. 
Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to apply carburetor heat.
