Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing

9 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air taxi & commuter - Scheduled
Analysis 
According to the flight crew, the instrument approach was flown above the glideslope in anticipation of 
mechanical turbulence. As the airplane descended through 500 ft, the pilot monitoring notified the pilot 
flying that the airplane was high on the approach. The airplane continued the approach above the 
glideslope, and the landing flare was conducted too high, which resulted in an excessive sink rate. The 
pilot flying attempted to arrest the sink rate but was unable to do so, and the airplane landed harder than 
expected, which resulted in a tail strike and substantial damage to the lower aft fuselage. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's unstabilized approach and improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing.
