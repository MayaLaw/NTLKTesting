Location:
Holland, Michigan
Accident Number:
CEN16LA363
Date & Time:

Registration:
N4513S
Aircraft:
CGS AVIATION HAWK AERO II
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot stated that the experimental light sport airplane experienced a partial loss of engine 
power during climb after takeoff about 80 to100 ft above ground level. The airplane entered an 
aerodynamic stall, so the pilot decreased the pitch attitude to recover, but the airplane then impacted 
power lines. 
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed numerous items that had not been performed in 
accordance with the engine manufacturer's maintenance instructions, one of which was the correct 
installation of a quick release connector in the fuel lines. When the quick release connector was tested, it 
leaked a substantial amount of air into the fuel system; therefore, it is likely that air entered the fuel 
system during the flight and resulted in the partial loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The improper installation of quick release connectors in the fuel lines, which was not in 
accordance with the engine manufacturer's maintenance instructions and allowed air to be 
introduced into the fuel system and resulted in a partial loss of engine power. Also causal to 
the accident was the pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and exceedance of the 
airplane's critical angle of attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with 
power lines.
