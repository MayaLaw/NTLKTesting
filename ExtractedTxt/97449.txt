Analysis 
During takeoff on a night aerial observation flight, the pilot reported that the airplane did not accelerate 
adequately, and he chose to abort the takeoff. The airplane continued off the end of the runway and 
came to rest in a field about 750 ft past the departure end, resulting in substantial damage to the wings 
and fuselage.
Examination revealed that the left engine turbocharger compressor air duct was disconnected from the 
throttle body. The right engine's engine-driven fuel pump was contaminated with water and debris and 
would not produce normal pressures and flow; however, whether these anomalies were present at the 
time of the accident or occurred as a result of or after the accident could not be determined. There were 
no other anomalies observed that would have precluded normal engine operation. 
Review of performance information revealed that, given the airplane's weight and atmospheric 
conditions at the time of the accident, the pilot had adequate runway available to accelerate the airplane 
to a decision speed, abort the takeoff, and stop on the remaining runway. Airport surveillance video 
revealed that the pilot did not activate the pilot-controlled runway lighting before takeoff, and tire skid 
marks on the runway were consistent with heavy braking within the last 200 ft of the runway's paved 
surface. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's delayed decision to abort the 
takeoff. The pilot's failure to activate the runway lighting system before takeoff likely contributed to the 
accident by reducing his ability to judge the airplane's acceleration with respect to the runway distance 
remaining and abort the takeoff in a timely manner upon recognizing an anomaly.
