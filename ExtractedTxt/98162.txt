Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-quipped airplane reported that, during landing on a grass strip, the airplane 
bounced, and he subsequently performed a successful go-around. On the second landing attempt, shortly 
after touchdown, the airplane bounced again and instead of going around, he "decided to try to save the 
landing." Shortly after the airplane stopped bouncing, the airplane veered left, exited the runway to the 
left, and impacted trees. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing, which resulted in a runway excursion 
and subsequent impact with trees.
