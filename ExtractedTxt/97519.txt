Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, the tailwheel-equipped airplane exited the runway to the 
left, struck a runway light, and impacted a ditch. The left main landing gear separated from the airplane, 
and the airplane came to rest nose down. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left lower fuselage and left wing.
The pilot added that, while he was at the departure airport before the flight, due to jet blast, he was 
blown off a ladder during the preflight inspection and that the airplane's tail section was "picked" up and 
slammed several times onto the ground. He examined the airplane and did not find any anomalies. The 
pilot reported that there no control issues or anomalies during takeoff but that, during the flight to the 
accident airport, he felt the airplane was out of trim. 
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that, during a postaccident examination, he 
could not determine if the damage to the tailwheel was sustained before the accident or when the 
airplane impacted the ditch. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.
