Analysis 
According to the flight instructor, after an uneventful training flight, the airplane was returning to home 
base. After touchdown and during the landing roll, the airplane veered to the right of the centerline and 
stopped. The instructor exited the airplane and discovered that the right main landing gear had collapsed. 
Postaccident examination of the landing gear revealed that the right aft main landing gear trunnion 
bracket had failed and that the wing spar web was damaged. A visual examination of the fracture 
surfaces revealed that the landing gear trunnion bracket failed during an overstress event. A review of 
the logbooks did not reveal any recent maintenance to the gear assembly. The investigation could not 
determine when the overstress event occurred that resulted in the failure of right main landing gear 
trunnion bracket.
