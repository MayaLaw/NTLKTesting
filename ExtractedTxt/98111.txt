Registration:
N893JA
Aircraft:
Cessna 172

Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, shortly after departing on a discovery flight, the airplane began veering 
left. He applied right rudder and aileron; however, the airplane continued to veer left. He 
recalled hearing the stall warning horn and stated that he lowered the nose and adjusted the 
trim, but the airplane continued in a nose-down position and impacted the ground.
A video of the accident flight showed the airplane in a high- pitch attitude shortly after takeoff, 
followed by the left wing dropping and a rapid descent, consistent with an aerodynamic stall. 
Given that the pilot had just taken off, there was insufficient altitude to recover from the stall.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage. A 
postaccident examination did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction 
that would have precluded normal operation. The examination revealed a flap setting of 30°. 
Weight and balance calculations determined that the airplane was loaded about 138 lbs over its 
maximum gross weight, which, in combination with the flap setting during takeoff, would have 
adversely affected the airplane’s climb rate. In an attempt to maintain a positive rate of climb, 
the pilot inadvertently exceeded the airplane’s critical angle of attack and aerodynamically 
stalled the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper flap setting for takeoff and subsequent exceedance of the airplane’s
