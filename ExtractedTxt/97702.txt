Registration:

Piper PA46

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During landing, the airplane bounced, and the pilot applied power to go around. The pilot 
reported that the engine did not produce full power and the airplane began to slow down. 
Onboard data indicated that the pilot accelerated the airplane to a maximum speed of 70 kts 
before he retracted the flaps; the airplane rolled right and impacted the runway, resulting in 
substantial damage.
Examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that 
would preclude normal operation. The airplane's published stall speed in the landing 
configuration was 60 knots; and 69 kts with landing gear and flaps retracted. The procedure 
for a go-around included retracting the wing flaps incrementally after attaining an airspeed of 
80 kts. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's failure to attain the 
proper airspeed during the go-around, and his improper decision to fully retract the wing flaps 
before attaining adequate airspeed, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's critical 
angle of attack, an aerodynamic stall, and impact with the runway.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilotâ€™s exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during an improper go-around 
procedure which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
