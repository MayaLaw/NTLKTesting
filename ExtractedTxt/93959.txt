Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel equipped biplane reported that during the landing on a grass airstrip, he landed 
long and was unable to stop before the landing gear contacted the edge of an intersecting asphalt runway 
and the biplane became airborne. The pilot further stated that after becoming airborne he aborted the 
landing, but the airplane impacted the top of a tree(s), descended, and touched down on an adjacent golf 
course. The biplane sustained substantial damage to both left wing struts.
The pilot reported that there were no pre impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain the proper touchdown point on a grass airstrip and the airplane's 
subsequent collision with trees during an attempted aborted landing.
