Registration:
N9241J
Aircraft:
Piper PA 28-180
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot and passenger departed on a night cross-country flight using flight following. About 2 
hours after departure, the engine suddenly lost partial power. The pilot checked the engine gauges, 
which were all in the green, and advised air traffic control (ATC) of the loss of engine power. The pilot 
switched fuel tanks, then activated the carburetor heat. He tried switching magnetos and enriching the 
mixture for "a few seconds." He then leaned the mixture again and "deactivated the carb heat," all with 
no changes observed in engine power. The pilot declared an emergency with ATC and used his tablet 
computer's navigation application to align the airplane over a road. Upon touchdown, the airplane's wing 
impacted a guardrail, and the airplane subsequently nosed over. Although weather conditions at the 
nearest weather reporting facility about 50 miles from the accident site were conducive to the 
accumulation of serious carburetor icing at cruise power, the investigation could not determine whether 
the loss of power was a result of carburetor ice, and no postaccident examination of the engine was 
conducted to rule out other causes. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on available information.
