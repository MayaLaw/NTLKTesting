Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Butler, Pennsylvania
Accident Number:
ERA18LA163
Date & Time:
June 7, 2018, 11:00 Local 
Registration:
N7765X
Aircraft:
Vans RV4
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff on an extended crosswind leg about 800 ft mean sea level, the engine lost total 
power. The private pilot continued ahead and landed the airplane in a field. During the landing, the 
airplane impacted a wire fence and brush, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and 
wings. 
During postaccident interviews, the pilot reported that this was the first flight after he had made 
maintenance repairs to the automobile-converted engine due to an engine failure 1 month before the 
accident. He stated that he installed an aftermarket engine control unit and modified the fuel delivery 
software, which resulted in the engine running too lean for flight and likely caused detonation and piston 
damage to occur. During the run-up before the accident flight, the pilot was aware that the engine was 
not producing power as it should. However, he decided to depart with a known engine problem, and his 
decision to do so led to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to fly the airplane with a known engine problem and his improper 
modification of the engine control unit fuel delivery software, which led to the engine running too lean 
and resulted in a total loss of engine power during climb.
