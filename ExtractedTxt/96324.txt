Analysis 
The private pilot fueled the airplane to capacity before departing on a local photography flight. About 1 
hour after departing, the pilot was climbing the airplane to cruise altitude for the return to the departure 
airport. About 800 to 1,000 ft above mean sea level, the airplane experienced a sudden, total loss of 
engine power over open water and beyond gliding distance to shore. The pilot prepared to ditch and 
attempted five engine restarts without success. The propeller continued to windmill as the airplane 
landed upright, but subsequently sank in about 12 ft of saltwater. The airplane was recovered 12 days 
later and a fuel sheen was observed in the area.
The wreckage was examined following recovery and the engine crankshaft could not be rotated due to 
saltwater corrosion. Examination of the engine-driven fuel pump revealed that the drive shaft remained 
intact and could be actuated by hand with no anomalies noted. The engine and its ignition and induction 
systems could not be thoroughly examined or tested due to extensive saltwater corrosion; therefore, the 
reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because saltwater corrosion 
precluded a complete examination.
