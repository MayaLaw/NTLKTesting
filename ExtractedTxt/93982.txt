Registration:
N91AK
Aircraft:
DEHAVILLAND DHC-2
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
3 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air taxi & commuter - Scheduled
Analysis 
The airline transport pilot was conducting a scheduled commuter flight between remote villages in a 
float-equipped airplane. After making an intermediate stop to drop off a company maintenance 
technician at a remote lake, the pilot back-taxied the airplane to the east in preparation for a westerly 
departure. He estimated the wind at 15 knots with increasing gusts to 25 knots from the west. Ground 
witnesses and passengers on board the airplane reported that the pilot initiated a takeoff to the west, 
toward an area of rising, tree-covered terrain. After becoming airborne, the airplane entered a left turn to 
avoid the terrain. The left turn steepened, and the airplane then entered a steep nose-down descent into 
the terrain. The pilot reported that he did not recall any preaccident mechanical problems with the 
airplane. Due to his injuries, he was unable to recall the events of the accident. 
Postaccident examination revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies of the airplane. Given the 
witness accounts of the accident, it is likely that the pilot exceeded the airplane's critical angle of attack 
during the initial climb toward and subsequent turn away from rising terrain, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall and loss of control at an altitude too low for recovery.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the initial climb and turn after takeoff, which 
resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall.
