Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Post Oak, Missouri
Accident Number:
CEN16LA355
Date & Time:
August 30, 2016, 08:55 Local 
Registration:
N6490K
Aircraft:
Republic RC3
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a local flight when the airplane's engine started to lose power. The 
pilot attempted a forced landing to a field; however, the airplane collided with trees. Examination of the 
airplane's engine noted that compression was low in all cylinders, and rust was present inside the 
cylinders. The airplane was not operated for about 4 years and had flown about 2 hours since being 
returned to service. The partial loss of engine power is consistent with a degradation in cylinder 
compression, and it is likely that rust formed in the engine during the time the airplane was not being 
used. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power due to low cylinder compression. Contributing to the loss of engine 
power was rust formation in the cylinders due to inactivity.
Findings
Aircraft
(general) - Fatigue/wear/corrosion
Personnel issues
Scheduled/routine maintenance - Not specified
