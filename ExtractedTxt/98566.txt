Analysis 
During the takeoff roll on an instructional flight, the instructor noticed that the airspeed was not 
increasing above 50 knots. He aborted the takeoff, during which the airplane overran the runway end 
and collided with a berm, resulting in substantial damage. The airplane was recovered for examination 
and a pitot-static system test revealed significant errors in airspeed indication due to a leak in the system. 
The airplaneâ€™s maintenance logs were not provided for review, and the maintenance history of the pitot-
static system could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A leak in the pitot-static system for reasons that could not be determined based on the 
available information, which resulted in an airspeed indication error, an aborted takeoff, and a 
subsequent runway overrun.
