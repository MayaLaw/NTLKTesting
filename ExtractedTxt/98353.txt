Defining Event:

Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated he touched down normally and during the landing roll, the airplane veered left coming 
to rest off the runway surface. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and 
horizontal stabilizer. 
Postaccident examination of the landing gear assembly revealed that the weld had failed on the joint 
attached to the main landing gear cylinder and upper scissor assembly. Most of the fracture surface of 
the failure surface had been obliterated by smearing and grinding, consistent with post-fracture damage. 
The degree of the fracture surface damage was consistent with the fracture and separation happening 
before the accident. Landing gear components are under cyclic loads at every landing and during landing 
actions (such as braking or taxiing). There was no evidence of fatigue, corrosion, or other progressive 
mechanisms would have led to the fracture of this joint from the strut cylinder. 
It is likely that a recent hard landing fractured the joint from the cylinder, but it could not be determined 
whether this occurred during the accident landing or beforehand due to the damage incurred after the 
gear collapsed.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A recent hard landing resulted in a fracture of a joint from a cylinder to a main landing gear.
