Analysis 
The pilot reported during a telephone interview that, while landing in variable wind conditions, his 
approach speed was fast, and that during the landing roll, the wind pushed the airplane off the runway to 
the right. He added that he did not apply full braking action.
The pilot further stated that, during the landing roll, a strong crosswind gust pushed the airplane off the 
right side of the runway into bushes. He described the wind as variable and gusting but did not report the 
wind speed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located about 10 miles south-southwest from the airport 
reported that, about 34 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 290° at 8 knots. The same 
automated station reported that, about 26 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 310° at 5 knots. 
The airplane landed on runway 3.
