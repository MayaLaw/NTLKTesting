Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Sedalia, Missouri
Accident Number:
CEN18LA220
Date & Time:
June 7, 2018, 16:45 Local 
Registration:
N8775M
Aircraft:
Beech A23
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting touch-and-go landings and had landed uneventfully four times. The fifth 
touchdown was soft; however, the airplane suddenly turned about 90째 to the left. The pilot applied right 
rudder and reduced the throttle to idle. The airplane departed the runway surface, during which the right 
horizontal stabilizer struck a light post and sustained substantial damage. The pilot reported that the left 
brake had locked while braking on rollout. A functional check of the braking system and flight controls 
did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation; 
both left and right wheel brake mechanisms functioned properly. 
Reported wind conditions about the time of the accident were wind from 230째 at 7 knots. However, the 
pilot indicated that he had checked the local weather about 20 minutes before landing, which reported 
wind from 100째 at 3 knots. Therefore, the crosswind component would have been about 130째 opposite, 
and 4 knots increased, from what the pilot had previously received. The pilot likely lost directional 
control of the airplane during the landing due to the unexpected wind shift.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during the landing rollout due to the unexpected wind shift, which 
resulted in a runway excursion.
