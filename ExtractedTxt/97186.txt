Registration:
N83581
Aircraft:
Aeronca 7AC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
According to the flight instructor in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, the purpose of flight was to provide 
a "proficiency check" for the pilot in the front seat. The pilot was on the controls and landed the airplane 
after accomplishing one pattern. During the subsequent takeoff, about 5 ft above ground level, the 
airplane's right wing "went down," and the pilot applied left stick, but the airplane struck the ground. 
During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, the instructor 
reported that he believed that the airspeed was too slow during the takeoff climb and that the airplane 
stalled.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right-wing lift struts. 
The METAR at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 20Â° at 4 
knots. The pilots used runway 15.
The pilot and instructor reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of 
attack during the takeoff initial climb, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
