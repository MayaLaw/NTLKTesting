Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing, the airplane bounced and then 
veered right. The airplane exited the right side of the runway, and he applied full throttle to abort the 
landing. He recalled that the airplane did not climb above the obstacles "because I failed to reposition 
the flaps on go around." The airplane collided with trees and stopped.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing and his subsequent failure to 
maintain directional control. Also causal to the accident was the pilot's failure to retract the flaps during 
the aborted landing, which resulted in the airplane's failure to climb and a subsequent collision with 
trees.
