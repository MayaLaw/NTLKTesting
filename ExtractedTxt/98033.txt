Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during landing, before initiating the landing flare, he saw a "white 
bird" heading toward the airplane. He applied left rudder to avoid the bird, and the airplane drifted left 
of the runway centerline. He then "[pulled] the yoke back," but the left main landing gear impacted a 
taxiway sign, and the airplane settled on grass adjacent to the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left-wing spar.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack while maneuvering to avoid a bird during 
the landing flare, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
