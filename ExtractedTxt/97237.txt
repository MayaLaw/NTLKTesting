Analysis 
During the 2-hour nighttime visual flight rules instructional cross-country flight, radar data identified the 
airplane on an easterly flight track when the first of two maneuvers over mountainous terrain was 
initiated. The first maneuver was a left turn from about a 48째 course heading to about a 176째 course 
heading. Throughout the turn, the airplane's altitude remained about 5,600 ft mean sea level (msl), and 
the groundspeed decreased to 55 knots. At the completion of the turn, the groundspeed increased to 
about 67 knots, and the airplane began to climb to 6,600 ft msl while continuing to the southwest on a 
course heading of about 195째. The airplane then made a right turn course reversal and resumed the 
easterly heading for about 10 miles.  
The radar data then depicted the airplane initiated a second left 180째 turn maneuver at an altitude of 
6,200 ft msl and a groundspeed of about 121 knots. At the apparent apex of the turn, the airplane was at 
6,100 ft msl and a groundspeed of 50 knots. The airplane then began to descend, and the groundspeed 
increased to 74 knots and then decreased to 50 knots. The last radar return showed the airplane at an 
altitude of 5,700 ft msl and a groundspeed of 67 knots near the accident site. Radar data revealed that 
both maneuvers were similar except that the second maneuver began over higher elevation terrain. The 
airplane's separation from the terrain during the second maneuver was as low as 1,200 ft above ground 
level (when the airplane was at an altitude of 6,100 ft and was over terrain that was 4,900 ft) before 
radar contact was lost.  
Weather reporting in the aera of the accident site indicated extreme turbulence and severe up and 
downdrafts during high wind conditions. Although there is evidence of strong wind in the area at the 
time of the second maneuver, there is no consensus among the available wind data. However, the upset 
occurred immediately downwind of relatively high terrain and inside of a temperature inversion, which 
can promote wave action and turbulence. Thus, the airplane likely encountered a downdraft and the pilot 
was unable to recover, resulting in the airplane's subsequent impact with terrain.
