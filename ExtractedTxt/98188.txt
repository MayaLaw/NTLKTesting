Analysis 
The private pilot was practicing crop-dusting maneuvers when the engine lost total power; he performed 
a forced landing in an open, muddy field. The airplane nosed over and sustained substantial damage. 
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that two of three bolts that secured the left magneto had 
come loose and were missing. The safety wire was broken, and the Sims coupling was heavily damaged. 
The magneto could easily be moved around, which disrupted the spark timing and resulted in a total loss 
of power.

The loss of two securing bolts that allowed the left magneto to move around, which disrupted the spark 
timing and resulted in the engine losing total power.
