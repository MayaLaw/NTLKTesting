Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot departed the airport to rejoin and fly in formation with a vintage airplane. After the airplane 
rejoined the formation, the engine lost total power; the pilot made a forced landing, during which the 
airplane nosed over and sustained damage to the vertical stabilizer. Postaccident examination of the 
airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have 
precluded normal flight operations. Downloaded engine data revealed a rapid drop of fuel flow and 
decrease in engine rpm that were consistent with fuel starvation.
The pilot attributed the power loss to "running the right tank out of fuel" after not switching the fuel 
selector from right to left fuel tank, as he had initially planned, during the flight. The pilot stated the 
high engine power setting he used to rejoin with the vintage airplane was a fuel planning consideration 
for which he had not accounted and that his preflight and in-flight fuel planning routines were rushed 
because of his desire to rejoin the formation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate fuel management, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel 
starvation. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's distraction of the formation flight.
