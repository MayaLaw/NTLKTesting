Analysis 
The Boulder sector approach controller was the first controller the pilot of CPZ6081 contacted when 
entering NCT airspace. The controller informed the pilot that the ATIS was "tango" and to expect a 
visual approach to runway 28L. 
Aircraft arriving from the south of SFO were routinely assigned runway 28L on initial contact; however, 
when noise abatement procedures were in effect, runway 28R was the preferential runway. 
When the Boulder controller realized that CPZ6081 would arrive at SFO during noise abatement hours, 
he informed the Woodside controller that he would change CPZ6081 to runway 28R. The Boulder 
controller subsequently changed CPZ6081's data tag on the radar display from runway 28L to runway 
28R and electronically handed the airplane off to the Woodside controller. 
The Boulder controller did not inform the pilot of CPZ6081 about the runway change to 28R and did not 
inform the Woodside controller that he had not passed that runway change information to the pilot.  
CPZ6081's data tag indicated runway 28R when the Woodside controller accepted the airplane.  
When the Woodside controller cleared CPZ6081 for the visual approach to runway 28R, that was the 
first mention of runway 28R to the pilot. The pilot read back "runway 28R," however, continued to 
prepare for the runway 28L approach. The flight crew had briefed for a visual approach to runway 28L 
with a backup ILS to runway 28L and thought they had been cleared for the runway 28L approach. 
The Woodside controller electronically handed off CPZ6081 to SFO ATCT, and the SFO local 
controller accepted the handoff; the data tag on the tower radar display indicated runway 28R.
