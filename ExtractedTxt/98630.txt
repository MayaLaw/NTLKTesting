Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During takeoff on the first flight since the airplane was built, the engine began to lose power.  
The passenger conducted a series of troubleshooting steps while the pilot flew the airplane.  
Unable to restore engine power, the pilot landed in a rock-covered field.  The airplane came to 
rest upright; a postimpact fire ensued and consumed most of the airplane. Postaccident 
examination of the engine revealed no evidence of any preexisting mechanical malfunctions 
that would have precluded normal operation.  The airplane was equipped with an electric 
constant speed propeller, which was controlled by an electric propeller controller.  Due to the 
postimpact fire damage sustained to the airplane, functional testing of the propeller control 
unit could not be performed.  Due to the lack of available information, the reason for the 
partial loss of engine power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the 
available information.
