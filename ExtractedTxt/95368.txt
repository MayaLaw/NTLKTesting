Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, as the airplane entered ground effect, while landing in crosswind 
conditions, a wind gust lifted the airplane and pushed it to the left. He added that he initiated a go-
around and "[pushed] the nose down slightly to gain lift." He further added that, during the go-around, 
he "must have relaxed the aileron countering the wind," and a wind gust pushed the airplane to the left. 
Subsequently, the airplane impacted the ground and spun around. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount. 
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system located on the airport reported that, about 23 minutes before 
the accident, the wind was from 180Â° at 15 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The student pilot landed on 
runway 16.
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings

The student pilot's failure to maintain crosswind correction during a go-around in gusting wind 
conditions.
