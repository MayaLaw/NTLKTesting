Defining Event:

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the landing, the airplane bounced and soon after he felt a "jerk and 
thump," and the propeller contacted the runway as the airplane slid across the runway with the nose 
down. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the leading edge of the right horizontal stabilizer. 
Examination of the runway surface revealed markings consistent with a hard landing on the nose landing 
gear. 
The pilot reported there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilot failed to maintain a proper 
landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing on the nose gear and its subsequent separation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilotâ€™s improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing and subsequent nose gear 
separation.
