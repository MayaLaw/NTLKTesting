Analysis 
According to the student pilot, on a previous flight the same day, while on final approach to the off-
airport landing site, the engine lost all power. He applied carburetor heat and was able to restart the 
engine and landed uneventfully. 
Following the event, the pilot sumped the fuel system and removed 7 vials of water. He then taxied for 
departure and completed an engine run-up. The engine briefly ran roughly and then began to smooth out 
with no anomalies noted. Just after departure, about 30 ft above ground level, the engine lost all power. 
The airplane impacted trees off the departure end of the airstrip and was destroyed by postcrash fire. 
Due to the remote location of the accident site, the airplane was not recovered or examined after the 
accident; therefore, the reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available evidence.
