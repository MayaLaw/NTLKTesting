Analysis 
After almost 1 hour of flight, the pilot turned onto the left base leg of the traffic pattern at the destination 
airport, where he intended to practice takeoffs and landings. During the turn, the engine began to sputter. 
The pilot turned toward the runway and tried to maintain clearance from trees located on the outside of 
the airport perimeter fence; however, the propeller and landing gear impacted the fence. The airplane 
came to rest upright about 5 ft from the runway edge, resulting in substantial damage. 
Postaccident examination of the engine and fuel system revealed no anomalies. The fuel selector handle 
had been removed, but the rod that rotated the valve remained intact and attached to the unit. The fuel 
selector was disassembled, and the ring was found located between detents. Based on its position, it may 
have been positioned between the left- and right-wing tip tanks; however, the position of the fuel 
selector at the time of the loss of engine power could not be determined. The pilot reported that there 
were 74 gallons of fuel onboard at the time of departure; however, neither the distribution of the fuel nor 
the fuel onboard at the time of the accident was determined.  
The reason for the partial loss of engine power could not be determined based on the available 
information. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information.
