Analysis 
The pilot reported that he departed with 26 gallons of fuel. He added that, about 3.5 hours into the flight, 
he asked flight following where the closest airports were because he had become concerned that he was 
"near the fuel limit." During their exchange, the engine lost power. He declared an emergency, rocked 
the wings, applied full-rich mixture, and restarted the engine, "which worked [for] 15 seconds or less." 
He then conducted an emergency landing near the end of a road, and the airplane bounced, veered left, 
impacted a pipe, and the nose landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion.
