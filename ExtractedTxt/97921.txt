Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Columbia, Illinois
Accident Number:
CEN18LA299
Date & Time:
July 28, 2018, 12:25 Local 
Registration:
N624FL
Aircraft:
Piper PA28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
3 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During the pilot's departure for the local flight, witnesses observed the airplane climbing at a shallower 
attitude than normal. The airplane appeared to level off and then contacted transmission lines about 1/2 
mile from the departure end of the runway, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane. A 
postaccident examination of the engine found fouled sparkplugs in cylinder No. 2 and a compression 
check of all the cylinders revealed that they were all below 60 psi. Cylinder No. 2 was at 18 psi, and the 
other three cylinders were about 50 psi. An engine manufacturer's service letter stated if the pressure 
reading is below 60 psi, removal and overhaul of the cylinders should be considered. 
A weight and balance calculation revealed that the airplane was operating near its maximum gross 
weight.
The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the partial loss of engine power due to low 
compression in all of the cylinders and fouled sparkplugs in the No. 2 cylinder. The loading of the 
airplane near its maximum gross weight combined with a reduction in available engine power likely did 
not allow for the airplane to climb normally.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The airplane's inability to climb due to reduced engine power as a  result of insufficient compression in 
all cylinders and fouled spark plugs in the No. 2 cylinder while operating near its maximum gross 
weight.
