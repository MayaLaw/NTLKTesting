Registration:
N7969C

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, shortly after departure, he heard two loud bangs followed by total loss of engine 
power. The pilot performed a forced landing to a highway, during which the airplane swerved to the left, 
the left wing impacted a concrete center divider, and a postimpact fire ensued. 
Initial examination of the engine found that the No. 2 cylinder was cracked, and the No. 1 cylinder and 
the base between the Nos. 4 and 5 cylinders displayed damage.  Disassembly of the engine revealed the 
piston-end master rod piece from the No. 5 cylinder fractured through the I-beam shaft.  Microscopic 
examination of the fracture surface showed evidence of fatigue. The initiation point of the fatigue 
fracture was damaged due to mechanical contact during the failure sequence.
The accident is consistent with a total loss of engine power following the failure of the No. 5 master rod 
end. The initiating point and cause of the fatigue failure could not be identified based on the available 
evidence.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the No. 5 piston rod end due to fatigue, which resulted in a total loss of engine power.
