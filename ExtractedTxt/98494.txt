Analysis 
On October 15, 2018, about 1310 eastern daylight time, Southwest Airlines flight 2437, a Boeing 737-
7L9, N7816B, encountered turbulence while descending through about FL280. As a result of the 
turbulence, one flight attendant received serious injuries.  The remaining passengers and crew were not 
injured, and the airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled passenger flight was operating 
under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Chicago Midway 
International Airport (KMDW), Chicago, Illinois, to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (KMHT), 
Manchester, New Hampshire.
The flight crew stated that prior to encountering turbulence the seat belt sign had been illuminated, and 
the flight attendants had been asked to be seated since turbulence was anticipated. The flight crew stated 
that upon entering a “benign-looking” cloud formation the airplane encountered continuous moderate to 
heavy turbulence for about 20 to 30 seconds. The flight attendants (FA) stated that soon after receiving 
the call to be seated, the flight encountered turbulence and the FA in the aft galley was thrown against 
the door and cabinets, and then onto the floor, injuring her right foot. After landing the FA was 
transported to a local hospital and diagnosed with a broken right foot.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
an encounter with convective turbulence that resulted in a serious injury to a flight attendant.
