Analysis 
The student pilot in the low-wing airplane reported that, after landing, she exited the runway onto a 
taxiway, which was occupied by a high-wing airplane that had landed before her. She attempted to pass 
the high-wing airplane on the left, but her airplane's right wing struck the other airplane's left wing lift 
strut. Her airplane then turned right about 180°, and the right wing struck the propeller and then the right 
wing of the high-wing airplane.
The flight instructor in the high-wing airplane reported that, after exiting the runway onto a taxiway, he 
"felt a small hit on the left side." He saw a low-wing airplane make a right, 180° turn around the front of 
his airplane and impact its right wing. 
The low- and high-wing airplanes sustained substantial damage to their right wings. 
The student reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper decision to taxi past another airplane occupying the taxiway and her 
subsequent failure to maintain clearance from the airplane.
