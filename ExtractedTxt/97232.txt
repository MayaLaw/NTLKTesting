Analysis 
The student pilot reported that the approach was stable, but during the landing roll, when applying the 
brakes, the airplane veered to the right. He released the brakes because he thought he needed to maintain 
directional control, but he then reapplied the brakes. Subsequently, he added full power to go around, 
and after becoming airborne, the airplane turned left. The right wing struck a runway sign, the student 
reduced power and landed the airplane, and he then applied the brakes to stop.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the stabilator.
The flight school's safety manager reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 13 minutes after 
the accident, the wind was from 210Â° at 7 knots. The airplane landed on runway 05.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in tailwind conditions.
