Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during approach, he made a relatively steep descent with full flaps. During 
touchdown on the unimproved airstrip, the tailwheel-equipped airplane landed hard and bounced. The 
airplane touched down again angled to the left and veered off the runway to the left during the roll on 
the uneven, dirt surface. Subsequently, the left wing impacted a tree, and the airplane pivoted into an 
adjacent tree.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard, bounced landing and subsequent loss of 
directional control on an unimproved airstrip.
