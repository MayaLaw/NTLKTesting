Analysis 
While performing an aerial application flight, the pilot heard a loud noise, followed by the nose 
of the airplane pitching up. The pilot applied full forward pressure on the flight control stick 
with no response. He then reduced the power to arrest the climb. A company employee who 
witnessed the accident reported that the airplane pitched up dramatically, hesitated, and then 
pitched almost straight nose-down before it impacted the ground.
A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the aluminum elevator pushrod was 
disconnected from the forward idler and that the attachment bolt was missing. The missing 
attachment bolt was later found undamaged in the wreckage and no additional anomalies were 
noted with the airplane or engine. It is likely the noise the pilot heard was the attachment bolt 
separating from elevator pushrod. After the separation, the pilot would have had little to no 
elevator control, which is consistent with his description of the accident sequence.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of aircraft control due to the separation of the elevator pushrod attachment bolt.
