Analysis 
The student pilot was on the second leg of a solo cross-county training flight. During the landing flare at 
the destination airport, he landed the airplane "hard," and it bounced twice before he was able to regain 
control. He taxied back to the beginning of the runway and conducted a run-up. Noting no anomalies, he 
taxied onto the runway and started the takeoff roll. During the takeoff, he pulled back on the yoke "too 
far," and the airplane climbed between 30 and 40 ft before entering an aerodynamic stall and colliding 
with the ground. The nose landing gear collapsed, and the propeller struck the ground, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the fuselage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane that would have 
precluded normal operation. It could not be determined whether the airplane incurred damage during the 
hard landing that would have impacted the pilot's ability to maintain pitch control during the subsequent 
takeoff; therefore, the reason for the loss of control could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of airplane control during takeoff for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information.
