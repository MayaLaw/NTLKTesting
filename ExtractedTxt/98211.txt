Loss of engine power (total)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that the airplane exhibited reduced climb performance during takeoff and that the 
engine began running rough when the airplane had climbed to about 150 ft above the ground. The pilot 
turned on the carburetor heat, but then removed carburetor heat when he perceived an increase in engine 
roughness. The engine subsequently lost total power and the pilot performed a forced landing, resulting 
in substantial damage to the forward fuselage and right wing.
Examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any evidence of mechanical malfunctions that 
would have precluded normal operation. Both fuel tanks contained fuel, the vented fuel caps were not 
obstructed, and there was uncontaminated fuel found in the carburetor fuel bowl.
The weather conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to the formation of carburetor icing at 
a descent engine power setting. Although the pilot did not observe any evidence of carburetor ice when 
he verified function of the carburetor heat control before takeoff, given the lack of engine anomalies, the 
pilot's description of reduced climb performance and the rough-running engine was consistent with the 
accumulation of carburetor ice. The reported increase in engine roughness after carburetor heat was 
applied is further evidence of carburetor ice, but the pilotâ€™s momentary application of carburetor heat 
would have been ineffective in removing the ice and restoring engine power. Additionally, the low 
altitude at which the loss of engine power occurred significantly reduced the amount of time available to 
the pilot to troubleshoot and restore engine power before the forced landing.
