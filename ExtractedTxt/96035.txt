Registration:
N35170
Aircraft:
Cessna 177B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and the student pilot were in a cruise descent toward the destination airport when 
the engine experienced a total loss of power. The instructor performed a forced landing to a corn field, 
during which the airplane sustained substantial damage. The instructor reported that the airplane had 25 
gallons of fuel onboard before takeoff and that the duration of the accident flight was 1.3 hours. Due to a 
recent engine overhaul, the instructor was operating the airplane at a high power setting with the mixture 
full rich. He noted that, during previous flights, the fuel consumption was about 11 gallons per hour and 
calculated that the airplane should have burned about 14.3 gallons of fuel during the accident flight. 
Since the engine was not being operated at normal cruise power settings, fuel burn based on information 
in the pilot's operating handbook could not be calculated; however, examination of the airplane after the 
accident revealed no usable fuel remaining in either wing fuel tank, and no breaches of the fuel system. 
Subsequent testing revealed no fuel leakage and no excessive fuel consumption during ground runs.
Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion; however, 
whether the pilot overestimated the fuel quantity before departure or underestimated the fuel 
consumption during the flight could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's inadequate in-flight fuel management, which resulted in a total loss of engine 
power due to fuel exhaustion.
