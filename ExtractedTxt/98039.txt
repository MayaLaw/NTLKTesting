Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the wheel landing in gusting wind 
conditions, the right main landing gear (MLG) touched down on the runway followed by the left MLG. 
During the landing roll, the airplane encountered a wind gust from the left. The airplane ground looped 
to the left, and the pilot applied full right rudder and brakes. However, the airplane exited the left side of 
the runway, and its right wing struck the ground. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing, the right aileron, and the right elevator.  
The pilot reported that the airport's windsocks indicated a 5- to 10-knot "right quartering headwind." 
The METAR located at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 210Â° 
at 5 knots. The airplane landed on runway 25. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
