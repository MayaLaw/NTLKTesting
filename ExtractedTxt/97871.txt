Location:
Oshkosh, Wisconsin
Accident Number:
CEN18CA293
Date & Time:
July 24, 2018, 10:03 Local 
Registration:
N45FT
Aircraft:
Just JA30 SUPERSTOL
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot stated that, during the initial climb after takeoff, the flight controls got mushy, and the 
airplane began to sink. The pilot added flaps and verified engine throttle position; however, the airplane 
continued to sink, and the flight controls continued to feel mushy. The pilot pushed the airplane's nose 
forward and retracted the flaps. The airplane descended and hit a ditch and gravel road before coming to 
rest adjacent to a chain-link fence. 
Examination of the airplane and related systems revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies that would 
have precluded normal operation. The pilot's statement, along with the video of the accident, revealed 
that the ;ilot did not maintain an adequate airspeed during the initial climb and should have climbed 
more shallowly. Due to the low airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, the 
airplane aerodynamically stalled.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the initial climb and his exceedance of the 
airplane's critical angle of attack, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
