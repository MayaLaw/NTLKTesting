Registration:
N9496D
Aircraft:
Piper PA18
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot receiving instruction in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing, the 
airplane touched down abruptly. He added that he taxied to the edge of the runway and saw that the 
airplane was leaning left.
The flight instructor reported that the pilot leveled off about 3 ft above the ground and allowed the 
airspeed to decrease. He added that he instructed the pilot to add power to "cushion the landing" and that 
the pilot attempted to do so, but the airplane continued to decelerate until it aerodynamically stalled and 
landed hard on the left main landing gear. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's receiving instructionâ€™s improper landing flare and his failure to maintain adequate airspeed 
and his exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during landing, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.
