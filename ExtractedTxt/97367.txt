Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a short-field takeoff, around 100 ft above the ground, he saw the primary 
flight display (PFD) airspeed indicator showing 0. He added that the engine appeared to be functioning 
normally, but he decided to level the airplane and attempt to land on the remaining runway. The airplane 
then began to turn left, and he added right rudder. Subsequently, the airplane touched down on an 
adjacent taxiway left of the runway, and the nose landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer.
Postaccident examination videos were provided by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector. The 
videos showed both the PFD and backup airspeed indicators moving in sync with air applied to the pitot 
tube.
The automated weather observation system at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 190Â° at 10 knots, gusting to 18 knots, and the calculated density altitude was 7,883 ft. 
The pilot was departing from runway 24.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain yaw control during a short-field takeoff in high-density altitude 
conditions.
