Analysis 
The pilot of a tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that the airplane veered to the right and then left. He 
corrected the veer to the right but "didn't get on it quick enough to stop the turn." The airplane continued 
to the left and ground looped. 
A postaccident examination revealed that the airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The automated weather observation station on the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 190Â° at 6 knots. The pilot landed on runway 26. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll with crosswind 
conditions.
