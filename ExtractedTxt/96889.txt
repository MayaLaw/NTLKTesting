Registration:
N118RG

Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that the engine was running roughly after he departed on the local flight; after 
troubleshooting to no avail, he decided to return to the airport. He stated that he "mistakenly landed in a 
pasture, short of the runway," and the airplane struck a tree. Although the pilot reported that the fuel line 
was not feeding fuel to the engine, he also reported that he believed he ran out of fuel; examination of 
the airplane revealed no evidence of fuel. Because of the pilot's belief that he ran out of fuel and the lack 
of evidence of fuel at the accident site, it is likely that the engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.
