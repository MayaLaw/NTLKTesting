Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Wellington, Florida
Accident Number:
ERA18TA222
Date & Time:
August 17, 2018, 16:00 Local 
Registration:
N80932
Aircraft:
Globe GC1B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During the airplane's initial climb in crosswind conditions for the personal flight, the engine experienced 
a partial loss of power, and the airline transport pilot reported that the airplane entered an aerodynamic 
stall. He attempted to lower the nose of the airplane, but with insufficient altitude, the airplane impacted 
a ditch parallel to the runway, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the engine's No. 3 cylinder had low compression, and the No. 
3 intake valve had hardened carbon deposit buildup on its stem. After the valve was cleaned and 
reinstalled, the engine compression returned to the normal range. It is likely that, during the initial climb, 
the intake valve stuck intermittently due to the carbon deposit buildup, which resulted in the partial loss 
of engine power and the airplane's inability to climb.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power during the initial climb due to a sticking intake valve on the No. 3 
cylinder.
