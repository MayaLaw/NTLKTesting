Analysis 
The pilot was conducting a local personal flight to fly over his home; it was the pilot's first flight in the 
airplane without a flight instructor. According to radar data, the airplane started to descend and the 
ground speed increased from about 100 knots to about 145 knots just before the airplane flew over the 
pilot's home. according to a witness, the airplane approached the house and the right wing tipped up, the 
airplane climbed briefly, and then the airplane rolled inverted, descended, and impacted terrain. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions 
or anomalies that would have precluded normal operations. The description of the flight sequence is 
consistent with an accelerated stall when the airplane entered into a left bank as the pilot flew over his 
home. 
The pilot had completed a total of 10 hours of instruction in the accident airplane. According to the 
pilot's flight instructor, most of the pilot's training time consisted of takeoffs and landings and minimal 
time was spent training maneuvers and performance characteristics.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control while maneuvering which resulted in the airplane 
exceeding its critical angle of attack and an accelerated stall.
