Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Columbus, Ohio
Accident Number:
CEN17LA104
Date & Time:
February 14, 2017, 13:30 Local 
Registration:
N88EB
Aircraft:
Beech D55
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The two multiengine-rated pilots departed in the multiengine airplane for a local personal flight in 
gusting crosswinds. The left seat pilot reported that he wanted to get current on his takeoffs and landings 
and that he performed the taxi and takeoff procedure. During the climbout, the left engine began to lose 
power. The left seat pilot gave the right seat pilot control of the airplane, and the right seat pilot 
conducted the landing. The left main landing gear struck the runway hard, which resulted in the collapse 
of the gear. A postaccident examination of the left engine and the fuel system revealed no anomalies that 
would have prevented normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of left engine power during takeoff and initial climb, which led to a hard landing in 
gusting crosswind conditions. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined because 
postaccident examination of the left engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation.
