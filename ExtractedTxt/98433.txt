Analysis 
The pilot reported that he did not want to take off from the wet grass airstrip he normally used, so he 
decided to take off from an asphalt road that paralleled the grass on the left side of the airstrip. During 
the takeoff roll, the left wing collided with tall vegetation, and the airplane veered left and exited the 
road. The airplane subsequently impacted a drainage culvert.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for takeoff, which resulted in a collision with vegetation and a 
subsequent loss of directional control.
