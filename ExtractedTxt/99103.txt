Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, during his first solo flight in the pattern, he aborted the first landing 
because he was uncomfortable with the airplane's runway alignment. During the subsequent approach, 
the airplane was crabbed slightly to the right. He recalled that, just before the airplane touched down, he 
applied left rudder, and that, upon touchdown, the airplane bounced. The airplane exited the left side of 
the runway and collided with a drainage culvert and nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the empennage.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. He added that the wind at the time of the accident 
was calm.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing, which resulted in a runway 
excursion and collision with a drainage culvert.
