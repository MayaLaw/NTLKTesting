Location:
Bowman, North Dakota
Accident Number:
CEN18LA354
Date & Time:
August 26, 2018, 11:55 Local 
Registration:
N666WW
Aircraft:
Beech 35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot and the passenger departed on a cross-country personal flight; the pilot 
indicated that, shortly after takeoff, the engine started "sputtering" and then lost power. The 
pilot attempted to restore engine power to no avail and performed a forced landing to a field, 
during which the airplane sustained substantial damage to the wing spars. A postaccident 
examination of the airframe, fuel system, and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical 
failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Although both main fuel 
tanks were full, further examination revealed that there was no fuel in the fuel lines, fuel, pump, 
or engine forward of the airplane firewall and fuel selector. Thus, it is likely that the fuel 
selector valve was not secured in the detent properly, which resulted in a loss of engine power 
due to fuel starvation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.
