Analysis 
The commercial pilot was performing an aerial application flight when the airplane impacted radio 
tower guy wires about 125 ft above ground level. The wreckage path consisted of broken guy wires with 
yellow paint transfer consistent with the paint on the lower section of the airplane. Examination of the 
airframe and engine revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation, and 
autopsy and toxicology of the pilot did not reveal any evidence of physiological impairment or 
incapacitation.
The radio tower was depicted on the map that the pilot had with him for spraying operations, and the 
pilot's son stated that the pilot had flown aerial application flights over the field for several years. 
Witnesses to the accident stated the airplane was flying normally before it impacted the guy wires, nosed 
up, and immediately descend to the ground. Although aware of the tower, the pilot did not maintain 
sufficient clearance from the guy wires while spraying the field, which resulted in the in-flight collision 
with the wires.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from tower guy wires while maneuvering during an aerial 
application flight.
