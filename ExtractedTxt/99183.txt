Lafayette, Louisiana
Accident Number:
CEN19LA108
Date & Time:
March 23, 2019, 16:06 Local 
Registration:
N2744Q
Aircraft:
Cessna A185
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot, who was the owner of the airplane, stated that the flight was uneventful and that the 
touchdown and rollout was "smooth" until he began to turn the airplane off the runway onto 
the taxiway. At that time, the right brake "grabbed very hard" and the airplane ground looped, 
resulting in substantial damage to the left aileron and left wing structure.
Postaccident examination of the brakes revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that 
would have precluded normal operation. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with 
the pilot’s failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.
