Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during takeoff, he applied right rudder to counteract the left turning tendencies of 
the airplane, but the airplane continued left of the runway centerline. He was unable to correct back to 
the runway centerline when the airplane was about 5 to 10 ft above the ground, so he decided to abort 
the takeoff and land on the grass left of the runway. During the landing, the airplane landed hard, the 
nose landing gear "dug" into the grass, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare during the aborted takeoff, which resulted in a hard landing and a 
nose-over.
