Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
VALPARAISO, Indiana
Accident Number:
CEN18LA165
Date & Time:
May 8, 2018, 14:15 Local 
Registration:
N99GN
Aircraft:
Piper PA 34-200
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot receiving instruction and the flight instructor were conducting multiple approaches to the 
airport. During a simulated engine-out go-around, when the pilot advanced the throttle of the operating 
engine to full power, he allowed the airspeed to drop below the single-engine minimum controllable 
airspeed. Subsequently, the pilot lost airplane control, and the airplane descended and impacted terrain. 
Examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or 
failures that would have precluded normal operation. The instructor should have been monitoring the 
pilot's airspeed control and his failure to do so contributed to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot receiving instruction's failure to maintain a safe operating airspeed, which resulted in a loss of 
airplane control. Contributing to the accident was the flight instructor's failure to monitor the pilot's 
airspeed control.
