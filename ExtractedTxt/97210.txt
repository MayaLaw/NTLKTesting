Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped biplane, the purpose of the flight was to accomplish the 
first test flight of the experimental, amateur-built airplane. During the takeoff roll, the airplane yawed 
left when the tail lifted. He reported that the airplane became airborne but would not accelerate. The 
airplane remained in ground effect, exited the runway, collided with rising terrain, and subsequently 
nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the rudder and the left main and subwings. 
The METAR at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 40° at 4 
knots. The temperature was 81°F, and the dew point was 27°F. The barometric setting was 30.12 inches 
of mercury, and the airport elevation was 4,456 ft. The density altitude was 6,742 ft. The pilot used 
runway 8.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain a positive climb rate after takeoff in high-density altitude conditions, which 
resulted in a collision with terrain.
