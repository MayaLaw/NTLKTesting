Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing, the airplane ballooned and 
then touched down on the left side of the runway centerline and exited the left side of the runway. The 
pilot braked hard in the grass safety area to avoid colliding with an airplane on a nearby taxiway, and the 
airplane subsequently nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and the rudder.
The pilot reported that the accident was a result of pilot error.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings

subsequent loss of directional control and excessive brake application.
