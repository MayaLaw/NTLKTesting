Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane slowed, and the stall warning sounded 
as the main landing gear contacted the runway. He added that it appeared that the airplane had landed, 
but he then observed the nose drop below the horizon. He added power to go around, but the nosewheel 
impacted the runway, and the airplane pitched "rearward." Subsequently, the airplane porpoised, the 
nose landing gear strut collapsed, and he aborted the go-around. The student taxied the airplane to park 
without further incident.
The flight instructor reported that he witnessed that the airplane on approach was a little flat but did not 
appear to be unstable. The student then pitched the airplane for the numbers, the airplane floated down 
the runway, and it then touched down in a flat attitude. Subsequently, the airplane bounced 2 to 3 ft, 
porpoised, and the student was then able to taxi from the runway. The flight instructor added that the 
student was too late on the flare and that all of the energy came down on the nosewheel. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 250Â° at 7 knots. The student pilot landed the airplane on runway 27.
