Registration:
N8371P

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot stated that before departing on a local flight, he was delayed for about 10 minutes on 
the ground waiting for other traffic before he could back-taxi to the run-up area before takeoff. He 
completed the engine run-up and takeoff roll with no anomalies noted. After takeoff, when the airplane 
was about 300 ft above the runway, the engine experienced a total loss of power and the propeller 
windmilled. The pilot lowered the landing gear and touched down on the remaining runway. The 
airplane overran the departure end, traveled down an embankment, and came to rest upright in low 
brush. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The weather conditions at the time 
of the accident were conducive to the formation of serious carburetor icing at glide (idle) power settings. 
Thus, it is likely that during the ground delay, a period during which the engine would typically be 
operating at low power, carburetor ice formed, which resulted in a total loss of engine power during the 
initial climb.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power during initial climb due to carburetor ice that formed during an extended 
ground delay.
