Registration:
N761DV
Aircraft:
Cessna 210
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Aerial observation
Analysis 
The commercial pilot stated that he did not visually check either fuel tank before takeoff because he had 
observed the airplane being fueled the day before; he assumed that the tanks were full (44.5 gallons of 
usable fuel per tank, 89 gallons total) and that he would have sufficient fuel (6.5 hours) for his estimated 
5-hour aerial survey flight. He departed with the fuel selector positioned to the left tank; his normal 
routine was to switch fuel tanks every hour for the first 4 hours of flight. About 3 hours into the flight, 
the engine lost total power. The pilot switched the fuel selector to the right tank and attempted to restart 
the engine to no avail; he made a forced landing to a snow-covered field, which resulted in substantial 
damage to the fuselage, an engine mount, and the firewall. Postaccident examination revealed that the 
left- and right-wing fuel tanks were undamaged, that both fuel caps were secure, and that there was no 
evidence of leaks. The left tank was empty, and 33 gallons of fuel were drained from the right tank. 
Visual examination of the engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that 
would have precluded normal operation. Although the pilot indicated that his typical routine was to 
switch fuel tanks every hour, given the amount of fuel remaining in the right tank, it is likely that the 
pilot did not adequately manage the fuel supply during flight, which resulted in the total loss of engine 
power due to fuel starvation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate fuel management, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel 
starvation.
