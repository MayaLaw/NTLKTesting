Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot reported that the agricultural airplane was loaded with 2,700 lbs of product and 130 to 140 
gallons of fuel. He stated that the engine gauges had normal indications but that, during the takeoff, the 
airplane's tailwheel was still on the ground when the airplane was about 3/4 down the runway, and the 
airplane did not become airborne before the end of the runway. When the airplane reached the end of the 
runway, he applied full flaps to "jump" a drainage ditch at the end. The airplane then impacted the 
ground on the opposite side of the ditch and incurred substantial damage to the wings, landing gear, aft 
fuselage, and tail surfaces. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Based on the reported fuel and 
product load on board, the airplane's calculated gross weight was about 523-574 lbs over the airplane's 
maximum gross weight. In addition, the density altitude at the time of the accident was about 2,200 ft.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper weight-and-balance calculations and his decision to take off with the airplane at a 
high gross weight in high density altitude conditions, which resulted in an attempted takeoff that 
exceeded the airplane's performance capability. Also causal was the pilot's failure to abort the takeoff 
while sufficient runway remained.
