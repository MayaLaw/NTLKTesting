Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, shortly after takeoff, the airplane drifted left.

takeoff. He then reduced the engine power, but the airplane landed hard and bounced, and both main 
wheels separated. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the tail cone. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
