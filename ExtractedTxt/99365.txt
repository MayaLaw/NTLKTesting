Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that after an uneventful flight in an experimental airplane he set up for landing.  At 
about 1,200 feet he reduced the throttle to idle, turned on the carburetor heat, and entered the traffic 
pattern.  After turning final, when the pilot began to reach for the throttle, the propeller stopped 
spinning.  The engine had lost complete power, with no engine roughness or abnormal noises. Since the 
airplane was about 50 ft above the ground, the pilot continued to land onto the runway. The airplane 
bounced and when it touched back down, the airplane departed the left side of the runway. The pilot 
redirected the airplane back toward the runway surface, but the nose gear collapsed on the rough grass.  
The nearest weather reporting station indicated temperature 13°C, dewpoint 4°C. Review of the 
Carburetor Icing Probability Chart revealed that, given the temperature and dewpoint, the conditions 
were on the line between serious icing at glide power and serious icing at cruise power. During a 
telephone conversation the pilot reported that the carburetor heat system takes hot air from near the 
muffler to keep the carburetor from icing up. It is likely that the carburetor accumulated ice while in 
cruise flight and the carburetor heat, when applied when the pilot reduced the throttle to idle, was not 
sufficient to remove the carburetor ice which resulted in a loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A complete loss of engine power due to carburetor icing.
