Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, shortly after takeoff while climbing through 800 ft mean sea level 
(msl), the engine manifold pressure began to drop, and the engine “sounded irregular.” The 
pilot initiated a return to the airport and requested to land. The pilot and pilot-rated passenger 
reported that the engine did not respond when the throttle was reduced during the landing 
approach. The airplane continued toward the runway at high speed and touched down within 
the last third of the runway surface, where it bounced several times.
The pilot first pulled the mixture control to idle/cut off, but when the engine did not respond, 
richened the mixture, applied full throttle, and initiated an aborted landing. The airplane 
became airborne, entered a right bank, and began to descend before impacting the ramp near a 
hangar, resulting in substantial damage. The wind conditions at the time of the accident were 
consistent with a quartering tailwind of about 8 knots for the landing runway. 
Examination of the engine revealed no anomalies, and the reasons for the initial loss of 
manifold pressure could not be determined based on the available information. However, the 
circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot’s exceedance of the airplane’s 
critical angle of attack after the airplane became airborne, which resulted in an aerodynamic 
stall, loss of control, and impact with the ramp.
