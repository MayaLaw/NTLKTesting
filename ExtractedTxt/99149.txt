Analysis 
The pilot stated that after landing the airplane at night, the taxiway that he normally used was 
occupied, so he taxied toward the ramp via an alternate taxiway. As he approached the ramp, 
there were four or five airplanes on the ramp, and the pilot asked the copilot if the area was 
clear on the right side. The pilot was referring to the ground path, but the copilot thought he 
was referring to the other airplanes. When the copilot replied that they were clear, the pilot 
turned right. The airplane then exited the taxiway onto grass and the nosewheel struck 
concrete, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage structure above the nose landing 
gear. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the 
airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to keep the airplane on the taxiway while taxiing at night. Contributing to the 
accident was a miscommunication between the flight crewmembers about the position of the 
airplane.
