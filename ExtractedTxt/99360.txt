Date & Time:

Registration:
N156LZ
Aircraft:
STORCH FL-156C
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff, the engine lost oil pressure and subsequently lost total power. The pilot 
maneuvered the airplane to return to the airport, but the airplane touched down in a field and 
came to rest upright.  
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed evidence of an oil leak. The leak likely came 
from the No. 3 cylinder, as the valve cover was loose, with a gap between the cylinder and the 
valve cover, which was likely the result of an improperly torqued allen screw. The improper 
torquing likely occurred during the pilot’s recent inspection of the crankcase throughbolts and re-
installation of the engine’s four valve covers. Eventually, the No. 3 allen screw became loose 
during the engine run-up and continued to loosen during the taxi, takeoff, and climb phases of 
flight, which resulted in a loss of engine oil and a subsequent total loss of engine power due to 
oil starvation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s improper installation of the No. 3 cylinder valve cover, which resulted in an oil leak, 
oil starvation, and a subsequent total loss of engine power.
