Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while landing at a private grass airstrip, he 
observed 4-ft-tall corn surrounding the airstrip. He added that, during landing, the aileron spades "nicked 
a few blades of corn" and that the corn was actually 8 to 10 ft tall. The pilot back taxied and decided to 
take off. During takeoff, the right wing struck a row of corn, which pulled the airplane into the corn. The 
left main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane ground looped to the left.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from tall corn along the edge of the airstrip during takeoff.
