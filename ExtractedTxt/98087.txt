Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that the student pilot was flying the airplane during the first takeoff of an 
instructional flight. The engine sounded normal and was operating properly with a fuel flow of about 14 
gallons per hour and between 2,800 to 2,900 rpm. The instructor stated that, during the takeoff roll, the 
student rotated the airplane about 60 mph. Initially, the pitch was high, but then the student lowered the 
airplane's nose to the horizon. Subsequently, the airplane reached about 100 ft above ground level but 
then stopped climbing, and the airspeed began decreasing. The instructor reported that the fuel flow and 
rpm were still normal. 
The instructor stated that he took the flight controls, lowered the flaps to 10Â°, and lowered the airplane's 
nose to hold 55 to 60 mph, "hoping that the ground effect would enable a speed increase." He turned the 
airplane right to avoid a tree line and conducted a forced landing in a field. The airplane landed on its 
main wheels, but the nose landing gear impacted rough terrain, and the airplane nosed over, which 
resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. 
Postaccident examination of the airframe, engine, and propeller governor revealed no evidence of any 
preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Therefore, 
the reason for the airplane's failure to maintain a climb could not be determined.
