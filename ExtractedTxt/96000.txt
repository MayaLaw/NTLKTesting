Analysis 
On September 12, 2017, at 1310 pacific daylight time, United Airlines flight 447, a Boeing 737, 
N69813, collided with Air Canada flight 785, a Boeing 767, C-GHOZ, while taxiing on taxiway C near 
gate 69B at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Los Angeles, California.  Both aircraft were 
regularly scheduled passenger flights and there were no injuries aboard either airplane.  The right 
winglet of the B737 had minor damage and the right horizontal stabilizer of the B767 was substantially 
damaged.
The B767 was being marshaled onto gate 69B and was instructed to stop approximately 15 feet short of 
the stop line because it is normally a tow-in gate.  The flight crew shut down the engines and awaited the 
ground crew to hook up the tow bar.  There are white lines painted around each gate area to aid ground 
vehicles driving on the ramp.  The B767 tail protruded beyond the white lines perpendicular to, and 
adjacent to, taxiway C.  
The B737 was taxiing out for departure via taxiway C in accordance with ATC instructions.  The captain 
reported that he saw the B767 and maneuvered left of centerline for more clearance.  He asked the first 
officer (FO), who was heads down making FMS entries, to look and verify if they had enough 
clearance.  The FO reported he saw that the B767 was hooked up to the tug but wasn't sure if it was 
being towed.  He judged that there was about 5 feet of clearance.  He said he saw no action by the 
marshallers indicating they thought the airplanes were too close.
As the airplane continued taxiing, the right winglet of the B737 contacted the horizontal stabilizer of the 
B767. The flight crew reported that they did not feel an impact but were told by ATC that the collision 
had occurred.  The B737 returned to the gate and deplaned passengers normally.  The B767 was towed 
into the gate and deplaned passengers normally.
Surveillance video from Gate 69B was obtained and captured the event.  The B737 nosewheel was 
tracking along the yellow centerline of taxiway C.
