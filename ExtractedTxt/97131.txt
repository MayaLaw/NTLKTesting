Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Garwood, Texas
Accident Number:
CEN18LA152
Date & Time:
April 27, 2018, 18:00 Local 
Registration:
N6637
Aircraft:
Grumman G 164A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was departing on an agricultural application flight when the engine 
experienced a partial loss of power shortly after takeoff. The pilot released part of the load of 
fertilizer and attempted to land in a nearby field. The airplane contacted a levee during the 
landing, which separated the landing gear. The airplane became airborne again, then settled 
back onto the ground and subsequently nosed over. The reported weather conditions were 
conducive to serious carburetor icing at glide power; however, the airplane was operating at a 
high power setting for takeoff. Therefore, it is unlikely that carburetor icing was present. A 
postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or 
anomalies and the reason for the partial loss of power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident 
examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
