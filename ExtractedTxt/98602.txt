Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane encountered a gusting crosswind from the right. The 
airplane was configured with 0° flaps, and the airspeed was about 55 knots, and the airplane was about 5 
ft above ground level. The airplane's airspeed was too slow for the gusting right crosswind conditions, 
and the airplane landed hard on the runway. The right main landing gear wheel separated from the 
airplane during the landing, and the airplane exited the runway to the right.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right main landing gear attachment points and the 
cabin's monocoque structure.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
The METAR at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 140° at 11 
knots, gusting to 19 knots. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during landing in variable gusting crosswind 
conditions, which resulted in a hard landing and runway excursion.
