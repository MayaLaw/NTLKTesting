Analysis 
After reaching 12,500 ft altitude, the private pilot attempted to adjust the boost control of the 
experimental amateur-built airplane's engine. When he did so, the engine experienced a total loss of 
power. The pilot subsequently performed a forced landing to a field. A postaccident examination of the 
engine revealed no anomalies. The examination revealed that the airplane was powered by an aircraft 
engine that was modified to employ a belt-driven automotive centrifugal supercharger. Due to the 
experimental nature of the supercharger installation, no determination could be made regarding its 
installation or operation; however, no outward signs of a failure or malfunction were observed. Based on 
the available evidence, the reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available information.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
