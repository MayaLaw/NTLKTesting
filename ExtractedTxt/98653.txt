Analysis 
The pilot stated that he was in cruise flight when he received an automatic dependent 
surveillance-broadcast traffic alert of traffic approaching from his one o'clock position and 
closing at "a high rate of speed." The pilot went on to describe control inputs and airplane 
attitudes during his response to the perceived threat, which ultimately resulted in a loss of 
control and aerodynamic spin. During the pilot’s attempted recovery from the spin, the nose of 
the airplane pitched forward uncontrolled and the airplane entered a high-speed, nose-down 
descent. It is likely that during these remedial actions to regain control, the structure 
surrounding the horizontal stabilizer failed, and the stabilizer separated from the airplane. The 
pilot then successfully deployed the airplane’s ballistic parachute system, and it landed in a 
pasture.
Examination of the failed structure surrounding the horizontal stabilizer revealed areas of 
delamination with dry glass fibers indicative of improper material layup with inadequate resin 
application. It could not be determined to what extent the inflight separation of the horizontal 
stabilizer was due to this defect, or whether the pilot’s control inputs during the response to the 
traffic warning, departure from controlled flight, and subsequent attempted recovery attempt 
imparted forces onto the horizontal stabilizer that were beyond its nominal structural 
capability.
