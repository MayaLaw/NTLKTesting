Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after accepting delivery of his recently purchased airplane, he requested the ferry 
pilot to "show [him] how to operate the aircraft." During his second approach, he felt that the airplane 
was low and slow and asked the ferry pilot if he should add power; the ferry pilot responded, "you’re 
fine." Shortly after, the airplane landed hard on the runway, the nosewheel and right main landing gear 
collapsed, and the right wing struck the runway.  
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.  
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. He added that, before the accident flight, he did not have 
any experience flying the accident airplane.  
The ferry pilot stated that he agreed to only be a passenger and not act as a flight instructor. He added 
that the airplane was configured for only a left seat pilot.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing. Contributing to the accident were 
the pilot’s lack of experience and training in the accident airplane make and model.
