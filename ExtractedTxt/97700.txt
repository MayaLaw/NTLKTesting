Registration:
N1401F
Aircraft:
Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, about 3 hours en route, he realized that the airplane's fuel level was very low. He 
started to look for nearby airports to land, but the engine rpm dropped, and he realized the airplane was 
going to run out of fuel before making it to an alternate airport. He decided to land in a nearby field, but 
on final, the engine experienced a total power loss. Subsequently, during the off-airport landing, the 
airplane's nosewheel touched down first and broke off. The airplane then "teetered," and both wings 
struck the ground before the airplane came to rest. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that he departed with about 40 gallons of fuel. He added that he must have burned off 
more fuel during taxi and takeoff than he realized and, that if he had stopped for fuel earlier in the flight, 
the accident would not have happened.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a subsequent total 
loss of engine power.
