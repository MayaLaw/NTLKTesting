Analysis 
The airline transport pilot had performed three touch-and-go maneuvers without braking. On the fourth 
and last planned landing roll about 30 mph, the airplane experienced an excessive tailwheel shimmy. 
About 25 mph, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted. Postaccident examination of the 
airplane revealed that the left main wheel/brake assembly was locked; thus, the wheel/tire could not be 
rotated. Partial disassembly of the wheel/brake assembly revealed a failed retaining bolt for the brake 
backing plate and a crack in the backing plate. The bolt likely broke off and became lodged in the 
assembly; thus, it is likely the failed retaining bolt and cracked backing plate resulted in a shift of the 
brake lining to contact the brake drum and led to a subsequent wheel lock when the brakes were applied.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failed retaining bolt and cracked backing plate, which resulted in a shift of the brake lining to 
contact the brake drum and a subsequent wheel lock when the brakes were applied.
