Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during the landing roll of a touch-and-go landing, the airplane began 
to veer off the runway, so he added power for a go-around. During the go-around, he saw that the left 
main landing (MLG) gear strut was bent and that the tire was "missing." He told the tower controller 
that he must have hit something and was instructed to fly by the tower. After the flyby, the tower 
controller confirmed that the left MLG was damaged and cleared the student to land. During the landing 
roll, the airplane skidded off the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer and left elevator.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about 7 minutes before the accident, 
the wind was from 320Â° at 8 knots. The student was landing the airplane on runway 21.
Examination of security videos revealed that, during the go-around, the airplane drifted left and that the 
left MLG struck a runway sign.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain the runway heading during a go-around with a crosswind, which 
resulted in the left main landing gear impacting a runway sign.
