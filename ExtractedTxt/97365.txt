Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he was aligned with the right edge of the 80-ft-
wide private, grass airstrip during short final. The pilot slipped the airplane to the left, but the right main 
landing gear contacted the tall wheat field that bordered the runway, and the airplane began to veer right. 
He added that the airplane continued to the right and subsequently nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right lift strut. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot indicated that he should have initiated an immediate go-around procedure once he realized the 
approach was not normal.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain the runway centerline and his subsequent decision to not perform a go-
around, which resulted in the main landing gear contacting tall wheat and a subsequent loss of control.
