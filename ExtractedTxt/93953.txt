Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel equipped airplane reported that during the landing roll out with the tailwheel 
down, the tail of the airplane lifted back into the air, at that time he attempted to abort the landing. The 
pilot further reported that when the airplane became airborne the left wing dropped, then the right, both 
of which he countered. Subsequently, the left wing dropped again and struck the ground. The airplane 
exited the runway to the left and came to rest on its nose. The airplane sustained substantial damage to 
the left wing and aileron.
After the accident, witnesses reported to the pilot that a dust devil had touched down in front of the 
airplane during the landing.
The pilot reported that there were no pre impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inability to compensate for a dust devil during an aborted landing, which resulted in the left 
wing contacting the ground, a runway excursion, and the airplane coming to rest in a nose-down 
attitude.
