Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Following a cross-country flight, the pilot was circling in the area of the destination airport when he 
noticed an excessively high exhaust gas temperature (EGT) indication. He enrichened the fuel/air 
mixture to full rich and leveled the airplane in an attempt to "cool down" the engine, then noted that the 
airplane would not maintain altitude and that engine power was decreasing. The pilot performed a forced 
landing to a field, during which the airplane impacted two ditches, resulting in substantial damage. 
Examination of the airframe and the engine failed to reveal any mechanical anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation and the reason for the decreased engine power could not be determined. The 
calculated density altitude at the time of the accident was 8,814 ft. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined due to the available evidence.
