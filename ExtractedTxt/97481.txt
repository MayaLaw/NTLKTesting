Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Cheyenne, Wyoming
Accident Number:
CEN18LA225
Date & Time:
June 14, 2018, 14:45 Local 
Registration:
N4954W
Aircraft:
Rockwell International 112TC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airline transport pilot and his passenger departed on a short personal flight from an airpark to a local 
airport. The entire flight was conducted with the fuel selector valve selected to BOTH. During the flight, 
the engine rpm decreased and then increased several times before decreasing to idle. The pilot attempted 
to restore engine power but was not successful. The pilot performed a forced landing to a field, during 
which the airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage. The pilot stated that each 
fuel tank contained about 1/4 tank of fuel based on the reading on the fuel gauges and his knowledge of 
the fuel burn and the previous day's flight. He did not have a calibrated fuel stick for the airplane to 
visually verify the level of fuel. A postaccident examination of the airframe, engine, and fuel system 
revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded 
normal operation. Thus, the reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident examination did 
not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded 
normal operation.
