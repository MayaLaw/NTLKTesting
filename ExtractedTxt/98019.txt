Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing roll on the dirt surface, he 
“pinned” the tailwheel on the ground and that he then applied aft stick to keep the tailwheel on the 
ground. However, he was concerned about the condition of the last third of the runway, and he chose to 
stop before it. He reported that he applied the brakes "a little harder than normal" and that the tail rose 
off the ground. He released his brake application, but the tail continued to rise, and the airplane nosed 
over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and the rudder.
The pilot reported that there was still had about 1,000 ft of runway remaining but that he failed to 
recognize and correct for the momentum of the rising tail in a timely manner.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's excessive brake application and delayed remedial action, which resulted in a nose-over.
