Date & Time:

Registration:
N13FM
Aircraft:
Cessna L19
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While in cruise flight, the airplaneâ€™s engine began to run rough before the engine lost power. The pilot 
performed a forced landing during which the airplane impacted trees, resulting in substantial damage to 
the wing spar. Fuel was found onboard the airplane, and examination of the engine revealed no 
anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot reported that he did not apply 
carburetor heat following the loss of engine power. The atmospheric conditions present at the time of the 
accident were conducive to the development of serious icing at glide power; however, the engine was 
being operated at a cruise power setting when the loss of power occurred. 
The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined based on the available information.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available information.
