Analysis 
On June 16, 2018, about 2200 MDT, Compass Airlines flight 5774, N637CZ, Embraer 175, encountered 
turbulence while in cruise flight at flight level 300 while enroute to Calgary International Airport 
(CYYZ), Calgary, Alberta, Canada.   Of the 73 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant was 
seriously injured. The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly 
scheduled passenger flight from Salt Lake City International Airport (KSLC), Salt Lake City, Utah to 
CYYZ.
According to the flight crew, air traffic control (ATC) relayed pilot reports of a "smooth ride with light 
chop" for their route of flight. The airplane was in visual meteorological conditions and the seatbelt sign 
was illuminated. At the time of the turbulence encounter the aft flight attendant was finishing up 
beverage service and was thrown against the bulkhead and jumpseat.  The flight attendant was unable to 
complete her duties due to the injury and two passengers assisted the flight attendant until 
landing.  Upon arrival at the gate in CYYZ, the flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she 
was diagnosed with a broken vertebra.
