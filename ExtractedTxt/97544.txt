Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during short final, the airplane encountered moderate turbulence, but he was able 
to maintain runway alignment and glideslope with constant power and flight control adjustments. During 
the landing roll, about 20 mph, the tailwheel-equipped airplane veered right. He applied full left aileron 
and rudder corrections, but the airplane continued to the right, exited the runway, impacted a post, and 
came to rest upright in a row of trees. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The weather observation station located about 7 nautical miles from the accident site reported that, about 
1 minute after the accident, wind was variable at 6 knots, gusting to 15 knots. The pilot reported that the 
wind was from 130ยบ at 21 knots, gusting to 30 knots. The airplane landed on runway 26.
The pilot added that, after landing, the wind sock was found to be damaged and was not indicating wind 
direction properly; it was replaced after the accident. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing in gusting tailwind conditions.
