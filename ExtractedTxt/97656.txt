Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting an agricultural application flight. During the takeoff roll and before 
becoming fully airborne, the right main landing gear (MLG) “snapped,” followed by the right 
wing dropping and striking the runway. As the right wing and propeller dug into the turf, the 
airplane spun, departed the runway, and subsequently impacted hay bales before coming to 
rest. The fuselage and right wing were substantially damaged. Examination of the right steel 
spring MLG revealed that it had broken off cleanly at the wheel and displayed features that 
were indicative of a fatigue failure. No maintenance records were available for examination, 
and the service history of the right MLG could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the right landing gear during takeoff due to a fatigue failure, which resulted in a 
runway excursion.
