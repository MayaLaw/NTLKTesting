Piper PA 18-150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, shortly after departure for a cross-country flight, the engine lost total power. He 
was unable to return to the runway, and the airplane impacted trees, which resulted in substantial 
damage to the wings and rudder. 
A postaccident engine examination revealed small unidentified contaminants in the gascolator and 
carburetor bowl. The amount and size of the contaminants were not enough that would be expected to 
cause a total loss of engine power. 
After the examination, an engine test run was conducted with no hesitations or anomalies observed.

A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available information.
