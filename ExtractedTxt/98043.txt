Analysis 
While descending toward the destination airport for landing, the private pilot made a "mayday" call and 
reported to air traffic control that he had "no throttle, no engine at all." Witnesses saw the airplane flying 
about 30 to 40 ft above ground level when it turned and descended into a flat, open field adjacent to a 
highway. Wreckage examination revealed that the airplane likely stalled and impacted the terrain in a 
nose and left-wing low attitude. Postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies with the flight 
controls that would have precluded normal operation. Thus, the pilot failed to maintain control of the 
airplane on approach to a relatively benign emergency landing area.
Postaccident examination did not reveal any pre-impact anomalies that would have precluded the 
production of rated engine power and fuel was onboard. Although impact damage precluded a test run of 
the engine, teardown examination revealed no anomalies with the engine or its internal components. The 
reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined based on the available information. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control following a&nbsp;total loss of engine power for 
reasons that could not be determined based on the available information.
