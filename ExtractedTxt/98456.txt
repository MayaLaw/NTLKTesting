Analysis 
The pilot reported that he departed with 14 gallons of fuel onboard the airplane. He added that he 
diverted to an airport 15 miles away from the destination airport due to ground fog, and while en route, 
about 2 hours 25 minutes after departure, the engine "died from lack of gas." Subsequently, he landed 
the airplane in a field.
The pilot further reported that he estimated that the fuel tank had "maybe an 1/8 cup" and that a 
"tablespoon may be more accurate." 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing, left aileron, and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the subsequent total 
loss of engine power.
