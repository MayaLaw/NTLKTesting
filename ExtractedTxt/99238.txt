Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the approach, the wind speed increased 
and became turbulent. He recalled that, during the landing roll, "I immediately applied a slight amount 
of forward stick," but when the tailwheel contacted the surface, "the wind suddenly changed to a 
tailwind," and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the rudder, both wing lift struts, and the engine mounts.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The nearest METAR, located at an airport 1 mile away from the accident site, reported that, about the 
time of the accident, the wind was from 290Â° at 10 knots, visibility was 10 statute miles, and the clouds 
were broken at 6,500 ft mean sea level and deteriorating. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 20.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain pitch control during the landing roll, which resulted in a nose-over.
