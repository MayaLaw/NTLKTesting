Location:
Brazoria, Texas
Accident Number:
CEN18LA292
Date & Time:
July 23, 2018, 12:15 Local 
Registration:
N74420
Aircraft:
Grumman AA5
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Sys/Comp malf/fail (non-power)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The student pilot and his flight instructor were conducting a local instructional flight when the airplane 
began to shake violently. A reduction of engine power revealed that the one of the propeller blades had 
separated about midspan. The flight instructor took control of the airplane and completed an uneventful 
forced landing in a nearby field. A postaccident examination revealed several fractured engine mounts.
A laboratory examination of the propeller revealed that about one-half of one blade had fractured. 
Further examination of the flat portion of the fracture surface revealed a pattern of crack arrest lines and 
striations that were consistent with fatigue cracking. The pattern of crack arrest lines indicated that the 
fatigue cracking emanated from the trailing edge tip of the blade. Damage to the fracture surface at the 
trailing edge tip of the blade obscured the exact initiation point of the fatigue cracking. The propeller 
had accumulated about 4,499 hours since its last overhaul, and about 11 hours since it was last examined 
during an annual inspection. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The propeller blade separation due to a fatigue fracture.
