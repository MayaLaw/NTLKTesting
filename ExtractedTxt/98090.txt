Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The sport pilot was conducting a personal flight in the special light sport airplane. During landing, the 
airplane touched down normally on the main landing gear. After 50 ft of ground roll, the nose landing 
gear touched down and collapsed; one propeller blade subsequently separated, and the airplane came to 
rest upright on the runway. Examination of the airplane revealed that the nose landing gear had 
separated at a location that the airplane maintenance manual (AMM) and a service bulletin (SB) indicate 
should be inspected for cracks. The separated fracture surfaces exhibited cracking and corrosion. 
Review of the SB revealed that due to the development of cracks, an inspection for cracks per the AMM 
should occur every 25 flight hours or 50 cycles, whatever occurs first. The AMM stated to use a 
flashlight and 10x magnifier to visually inspect the nose landing gear leg lower section and verify that 
there is no evidence of cracking in paint on or around the place of the weld between the tube and the 
bracket. The most recent documented nose landing gear inspection was about 2 years 5 months before 
the accident. Thus, it is likely that the nose landing gear was not adequately inspected and cracks and 
corrosion were therefore undetected, which led to the nose landing gear collapse during landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Inadequate maintenance inspection of the airplane's nose landing gear, which resulted in a nose landing 
gear collapse during landing due to cracking and corrosion.
