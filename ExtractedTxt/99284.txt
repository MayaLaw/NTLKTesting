Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, about 30 minutes into the flight, the oil 
pressure gauge needle entered the yellow (caution) arc. The pilot decided to make a precautionary 
landing at the nearest airport and to land on the grass on the right side of the asphalt runway. Before 
landing, he overflew the grass surface twice and then conducted a touch-and-go landing to assess the 
surface condition. The third approach and landing were normal, but during the landing roll, the main 
landing gear wheels encountered "a soft patch of muddy soil," and the airplane nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the empennage.
The pilot reported that the only mechanical malfunction that occurred was specific to the oil pressure 
gauge.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for landing, which resulted in a nose-over.
