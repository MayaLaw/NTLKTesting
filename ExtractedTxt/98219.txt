Registration:
N388MA

Diamond DA40
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, while on a downwind leg of the airport traffic pattern, he reduced the 
engine power to prepare for landing; however, the engine lost total power. The pilot then advanced the 
throttle in an unsuccessful attempt to regain power. He subsequently attempted an engine restart to no 
avail and, at that time, realized that the airplane would not be able to glide to the runway. The pilot 
performed a forced landing to a field about 1 mile short of the runway threshold, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the landing gear and empennage. Postaccident examination of the airplane 
revealed that sufficient fuel remained in the left fuel tank and that the fuel selector was found positioned 
to the left fuel tank; sufficient fuel also remained in the right fuel tank. Further examination of the 
engine, fuel system, and ignition system did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Although fuel unporting is 
possible with the amount of fuel that was available in the left tank, it was unlikely based on the 
airplane's attitude around the time of the loss of engine power. Thus, the reason for the loss of engine 
power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident examination 
of the airplane did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would 
have precluded normal operation.
