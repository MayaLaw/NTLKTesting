Analysis 
The pilot reported that, before departure, he noted that a NOTAM stated that fuel was not available at 
the airport where he had landed and had planned to refuel but that he felt he had sufficient fuel onboard 
to continue to another airport to get fuel if necessary. He assessed his fuel quantity and departed the 
airport, and subsequently, the engine lost power. He pitched the nose down, and the engine regained 
power, but the pilot realized that the fuel supply was almost exhausted. He attempted to maintain power 
and altitude but eventually chose to land in a field. He selected a touchdown point and circled to land, 
but the airplane did not complete the turn before he had to level the wings. The airplane touched down 
gently but overran the intended landing area, collided with a drainage culvert, and nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the composite fuselage and windscreen.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a total loss of engine 
power.
