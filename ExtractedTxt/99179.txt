Analysis 
Before takeoff, the pilot fueled the airplane’s main header fuel tank with 25 gallons of 
automotive fuel. Shortly after takeoff, about 400 ft above ground level, the engine lost 
total power. The pilot performed a forced landing to a dirt field, during which the 
airplane landed hard and impacted a sand dune, resulting in substantial damage. 
Examination of the fuel system revealed that the fuel selector was selected to the 
AUX/wing fuel tank position. The pilot stated that he never fueled the AUX/wing tank, 
and that he only filled and operated off the main header tank. The pilot reported, and 
examination confirmed, that there were no mechanical malfunctions with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. The accident is consistent with a total loss of 
engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot’s failure to correctly position 
the fuel selector prior to departure.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to properly position the fuel selector before takeoff, which resulted in a total 
loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.
