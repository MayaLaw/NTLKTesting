Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a night flight, while lowering the flaps for landing, the cockpit lights 
turned off. He attempted to turn the lights back on to no avail. He added that the precision approach path 
indicator (PAPI) lights were off and that he could not get the runway lights to turn on either. As he was 
landing past "the first arrow in front [chevron in the displaced threshold]," he heard a "thump." He 
taxied the airplane to the ramp without further incident.
The passenger, an airframe and powerplant mechanic, reported that, during approach after the cockpit 
lights went out, he used his flashlight to light up the cockpit. He was unable to correct the panel lights 
but observed that the runway lights were "bright." He added that, during the landing, he felt the "bottom 
drop out" and that the airplane landed hard and bounced. 
Postaccident examination revealed that the right horizontal stabilator sustained substantial damage. The 
pilot added that he and the passenger went to the beginning of the approach runway and found pieces of 
broken runway lights.
