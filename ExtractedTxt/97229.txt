Analysis 
According to the pilot, he was seated in the front seat of the tandem-seat, tailwheel-equipped airplane 
and made a three-point landing and applied full aft stick pressure once the tailwheel was on the ground. 
He could not recall the airspeed, but the airplane abruptly veered to the left. The right main landing gear 
(MLG) collapsed, and subsequently, the the right wing struck the ground. 
The pilot-rated passenger, who was a flight instructor, reported that the purpose of the flight was to 
perform a prebuy inspection for the pilot. He reported that there was a slight crosswind from the left 
about 3 knots during the three-point landing, and the stall warning horn activated. He described the 
landing as "perfect," but during the landing roll, the airplane veered hard left and ground looped.
The Federal Aviation Administration aviation safety inspector who examined the airplane after the 
accident determined that the right MLG wheel assembly "folded under the end of the gear leg and then 
separated." The airplane manufacturer examined the wheel assembly and reported that "an extreme 
sideload on the right tire caused the subsequent cascading failure of the right wheel and brake 
assembly," which likely resulted from the ground loop.
The METAR at the accident airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 
180Â° at 7 knots. The pilot landed on runway 22L.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll.
