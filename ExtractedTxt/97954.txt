Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, he had performed two previous touch-and-go 
takeoffs and landings. During the third landing roll, the tailwheel settled on the runway, and then the 
airplane nosed over. He reported that he was “not certain whether I accidentally stepped on the brakes or 
the brakes seized."
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and the rudder.
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector’s postaccident examination of the brake system revealed 
no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper brake application during the landing roll, which resulted in a nose-over.
