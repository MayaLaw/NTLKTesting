Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, at dusk, he made a wheel landing on an 
asphalt runway near mountains. He recalled that, shortly after a normal touchdown and during the 
landing roll, the tail lifted, and the nose veered right. He applied rudder to correct, but the pilot 
overcorrected, and the airplane exited the left side of the runway. He aborted the landing, and the 
airplane began to climb, but the left wing struck a large bush, and the airplane then impacted terrain.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the empennage, and the elevator.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll, which resulted in a runway 
excursion and an attempted aborted landing and impact with bushes and terrain.
