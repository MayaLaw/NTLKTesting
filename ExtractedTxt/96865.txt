Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting touch-and-go landings; the airplane was about 200 ft above ground 
level after a takeoff when the engine lost total power. The pilot cycled the throttle during the straight-
ahead descent, which restored power momentarily before the forced landing. During the ground roll, the 
nose landing gear separated, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. A 
postaccident test run of the engine using the fuel available in the airplaneâ€™s tanks and the intact fuel 
system revealed that the engine operated normally with no anomalies noted. The weather conditions at 
the time of the accident were conducive to the formation of serious carburetor icing at descent engine 
power settings. The pilot stated that he had not activated the carburetor heat at any point during the 
flight. Because the engine operated normally after the accident, the weather conditions were conducive 
to the formation of carburetor icing, and the pilot failed to use carburetor heat during the approach, it is 
likely that the engine lost power due to the accumulation of carburetor ice before and during the takeoff.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to apply carburetor heat during the approach for a touch-and-go landing, which 
resulted in a total loss of engine power during the subsequent takeoff.
