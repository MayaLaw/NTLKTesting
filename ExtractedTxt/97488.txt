Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during landing on a gravel airstrip, when the 
right main wheel touched down, the airplane veered right. He applied full left rudder to no avail. The 
right wheel exited the runway into soft, sandy soil, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot added that, after the accident, it was pointed out that the airplane had a flat tire and that there 
was a tire mark on the gravel runway from where the airplane touched down to where the airplane nosed 
over.
Probable Cause and Findings
