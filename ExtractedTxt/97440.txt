Analysis 
The commercial pilot was receiving his second training flight after purchasing the vintage single-engine, 
turbine-powered airplane. While on a visual approach, the pilot flew below the glidepath with a slow 
airspeed and allowed a sink rate to develop. Subsequently, the flight instructor assumed control of the 
airplane and applied full engine power; however, the airplane continued to settle and impacted terrain 
1/2 mile short of the runway. The flight instructor stated that he had "let his guard down" during the 
final approach and had not intervened quickly enough because the airplane descended below the 
glidepath. The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glidepath and the flight instructor's delayed remedial 
action allowed the airplane to descend and hit terrain short of the runway. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glidepath during a visual approach and the flight instructor's 
delayed remedial action, which resulted in ground impact before the runway.
