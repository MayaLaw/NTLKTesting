Location:
McClure, Ohio
Accident Number:
CEN19LA047
Date & Time:
December 16, 2018, 15:30 Local 
Registration:
N3165V
Aircraft:
Rans S12
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot warmed the engine to 120°F before taxiing to the runway for departure on a personal flight. 
While the airplane was climbing through 50 to 100 ft above ground level, the engine lost partial power. 
He ensured the throttle control was full forward and pumped the throttle control twice, but the engine 
speed continued to decrease. The pilot performed an off-airport landing on a field, during which the 
airplane stuck a power line pole and the right wing impacted the ground. After the accident, the pilot 
reported the engine had low cylinder compression and scoring on the piston and cylinder walls. There 
were also aluminum fragments within the cylinder. He said that the engine was overhauled about 1 year 
before his purchase of the airplane by the previous owner. He stated that he was "fairly certain" that the 
engine did not have any problems before the accident flight. He said the engine radiator was not covered 
for cold weather operation. He believed the piston failure was due to cold seizure. According to the 
Rotax 2-Stroke Maintenance Schedule, the engine had a minimum coolant temperature of 150°F. Given 
the available information, it is likely that the engine lost partial power due to a cold seizure of the 
cylinder/piston.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The cold seizure of the cylinder/piston due to the pilot's failure to adequately warm the engine before 
takeoff, which resulted in a loss of engine power during a departure climb.
