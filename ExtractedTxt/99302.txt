Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, after a three-point landing, during the landing 
roll, the airplane veered left. He corrected with right rudder, but the airplane continued left, so he 
applied brakes, and the airplane nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control and subsequent improper brake application during the landing roll, 
which resulted in a nose-over.
