Analysis 
The pilot reported that the airplane was low and that he felt "rushed" during final approach. He added 
that, during the landing roll, the airplane "started to veer off the runway," so he applied power to abort 
the landing and that, during the aborted landing, he "pulled back" on the yoke. The airplane then 
aerodynamically stalled and impacted grass left of the runway and then nosed over.
The fuselage, left wing, and vertical stabilizer sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during an attempted go-around, which 
resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
