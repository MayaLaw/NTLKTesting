Analysis 
During the closed course air race, the pilot of the race 13 airplane announced that he was passing the 
race 37 airplane on his right. A video recording of the midair collision showed that, as the two airplanes 
approached one of the racecourse pylons, race 13 was in a slight left bank behind race 37, which was in 
a level attitude. Shortly after, race 37 initiated a left bank, while race 13 was rapidly approaching race 37 
from behind. Just before the collision, race 13 rolled out of the turn to an almost level attitude. The two 
airplanes then collided, which resulted in damage to the right wing and aileron of race 37 and damage to 
two inspection panels and fairings on the forward left side of the fuselage of race 13. Both airplanes 
landed uneventfully after the collision. The pilot of race 13 failed to maintain adequate separation from 
race 37 while overtaking the other airplane.
