Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing and as the left main 
landing gear (MLG) touched down, the airplane encountered a wind gust and then veered "abruptly" left. 
He added that, as the right MLG touched down, the airplane "began skidding to the left," and the right 
MLG collapsed. Subsequently, the airplane came to rest on the left side of the runway and nosed down.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 260Â° at 10 knots, gusting to 15 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 32.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing in gusting wind conditions.
