Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while landing on a soft, grass runway, the airplane bounced. He added that, as 
the airplane settled back to the runway, the nosewheel "hit a soft spot" in the turf, and the nose landing 
gear collapsed. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The Federal Aviation Administration's Airplane Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3A, contained a 
section titled, "Soft Field Approach and Landing," which stated:
Touchdown on a soft or rough field should be made at the lowest possible airspeed with the airplane in 
a nose-high pitch attitude. In nose-wheel type airplanes, after the main wheels touch the surface, the 
pilot should hold sufficient back-elevator pressure to keep the nose wheel off the surface. Using back-
elevator pressure and engine power, the pilot can control the rate at which the weight of the airplane is 
transferred from the wings to the wheels.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare during a soft-field landing and his use of an improper soft-field 
landing procedure, which resulted in a bounced landing.
