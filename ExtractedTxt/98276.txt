Analysis 
The pilot reported that, upon landing, he activated the canopy motor to open the canopy about 2 inches, 
but the canopy continued to open, separated from the airframe, and struck the empennage. He added that 
it was standard procedure upon landing to open the canopy slightly to aid in slowing the airplane and 
egress in a runway excursion event.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the empennage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot added that the emergency canopy release, which 
anchors the canopy to the airframe when the canopy motor was turned on, was inadvertently released 
during the flight. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to verify that the emergency canopy release was in the correct position when opening 
the canopy during landing, which resulted in the canopy separating from the airplane and subsequently 
impacting the empennage.
