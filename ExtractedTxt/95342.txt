Analysis 
The private pilot stated that he had "disoriented" himself by holding the airport diagram "upside down" 
as the airplane approached the destination airport. Once oriented, he turned the airplane onto the 
downwind leg of the traffic pattern, noticed the airplane was "high," and disconnected the autopilot. 
During the final approach, the airplane was descending rapidly, and the pilot added power to complete 
the landing. However, nothing happened because he had not properly set the mixture control, which 
resulted in a loss of engine power once he advanced the throttle. With little time and altitude remaining, 
the pilot was unable to regain engine power before the airplane struck the ground about 1/2 mile from 
the runway threshold. A postaccident test-run and examination of the engine revealed no evidence of 
any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to properly configure the mixture control for landing due to disorientation because he 
had the airport diagram upside down, which resulted in a total loss of engine power.
