Analysis 
The airplane owner reported that, during the flight, he was seated in the right seat, and the pilot flying 
was seated in the left seat. The pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with single-engine land and 
flight instructor ratings. He added that the experimental amateur-built airplane had one throttle located 
on the far-left side of the cabin, one set of brakes located on the left rudder pedals, and nosewheel 
steering that was interconnected with the rudder pedals. 
He further reported that the pilot started and taxied the airplane for takeoff; performed climbs, descents, 
and turns; and then landed. During landing, the airplane was fast, touched down hard, and bounced 
about 20 to 25 ft. The pilot then said, "Oh that's alright I got it," leveled the airplane, and continued the 
landing. Subsequently, the airplane porpoised, landed with the nose left of the runway centerline, veered 
off the runway to the left, and struck a tree.
The owner added that, during the landing, he told the pilot "nose down, right rudder," and during the 
runway excursion, he yelled "brakes!" He added that the pilot never reduced throttle to idle, and he 
never felt the application of brakes.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage.
The owner reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's lawyer reported that his client was not the pilot flying the airplane because he did not have 
previous training in the category, class, and type of aircraft.
