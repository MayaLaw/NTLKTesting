Analysis 
The pilot in the experimental, amateur-built, tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the 
landing roll, when the tailwheel touched down, the airplane veered right. He increased the engine power 
to increase the airflow around the rudder, but the airplane then veered left and exited the left side of the 
runway. With full throttle applied and full flaps and unaware of the airspeed, the pilot initiated a climb. 
However, the left main landing gear struck a taxiway sign, and the airplane became airborne. The pilot 
reduced the throttle to idle, and the airplane touched down on the grass safety area and stopped. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left main landing gear attachment points.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during the landing roll and his subsequent attempted go-around.
