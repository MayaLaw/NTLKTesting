Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot was performing an aerial application flight with the airplane loaded with product near its 
maximum gross weight. As the pilot pulled up to reverse course after the second application pass, the 
airplane did not fly as expected. Because of his low altitude, he conducted a forced landing in the 
cornfield. The airplane came to rest upright and sustained substantial damage to left wing, vertical 
stabilizer, horizontal stabilizers, elevators, and rudder.
A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that one of the cylinders had low compression. This 
would have resulted in a partial loss of engine power. It is likely the airplane was at a low energy state 
during the pull-up maneuver to reverse direction, and the partial engine power loss would have further 
reduced the airplane's energy. These issues, combined with the airplane's high gross weight, would have 
made sustained flight difficult.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power due to low cylinder compression, which led to the forced landing 
following a pull-up maneuver. Contributing to the accident was the airplane's high gross weight.
