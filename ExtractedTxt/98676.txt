Analysis 
On November 5, 2018, about 1019 mountain standard time, a Piper PA28-181, N419PA, and a 
Piper PA28-181, N9299B, collided on the ground at Chandler Municipal Airport (CHD), 
Chandler, Arizona. The student pilot in N419PA, and the student pilot and airline transport 
pilot onboard N9299B were not injured. Both airplanes were operated by AeroGuard Flight 
Training Center under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. 
According to the operator, the student pilot had landed and was taxiing back to the runway for 
takeoff. The pilot of the second airplane was undergoing a practical test and his airplane was 
stationary as he completed pre-takeoff checks in the run-up area. The student arrived at the 
run-up area, completed his pre-takeoff checks, and subsequently attempted to taxi around the 
left side of the second airplane, during which his right wing impacted the trailing edge of the 
second airplaneâ€™s left wing.
Examination of both airplanes by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, revealed that 
N9299B sustained substantial damage to the left aileron, while N419PA sustained minor 
damage to the right wing.
