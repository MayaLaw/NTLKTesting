Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while flying over the grass runway, it appeared "rough but serviceable." During 
landing, he found the surface was extremely rough with tall weeds. During the subsequent departure, 
acceleration was "less than normal" due to the vegetation. When the airplane reached the pilot's planned 
abort point for the runway, he realized that he had misjudged the abort point. He initially thought his 
selected abort point was about 800 to 1,000 ft before the end of the runway, but it was about 100 to 200 
ft before the end of the runway. The airplane overran the runway, crossed a road, and struck a barbed 
wire fence.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The Federal Aviation Administration Airport Facility Directory for the accident airport, in part, stated: 
"[Runways] not recommended for [takeoff or landing]."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight planning that did not identify the unserviceable runway; his subsequent 
decision to attempt to takeoff from the rough, grassy runway; and his selection of an abort point with 
insufficient runway remaining, which resulted in a runway overrun.
