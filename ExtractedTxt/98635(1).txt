Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the approach, there was "heavy traffic" 
behind his airplane and a right crosswind. He added that, during a wheel landing, he tried to "maintain 
speed" to clear the runway, but the airplane began to "fishtail." He added power to regain control, but 
the airplane exited the left side of the runway, the left wing impacted the ground, and the airplane came 
to rest in a "lava field." 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that the accident was due to pilot error because of his lack of experience in the 
airplane. He added that he did not have a tailwheel endorsement and had a total of only 3 flight hours 
experience in tailwheel airplanes with a flight instructor. 
The airport’s automated weather observation system reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 220° at 9 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 17.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing in a crosswind. Contributing to the 
accident was the pilot’s lack of experience in tailwheel airplanes for which he did not have an 
endorsement.
