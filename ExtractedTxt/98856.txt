Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
According to the flight instructor, he and a student pilot were conducting a local, instructional flight. 
The instructor reported that, while flying about 800 ft above a shoreline, the engine started to vibrate, 
and it then lost all power. He tried to restart the engine twice to no avail. On the third attempt, the engine 
started, but it would not produce more than 1,200 rpm. The instructor saw people on the beach and 
decided to land on the water. When the main landing gear touched down on the water, the airplane 
immediately flipped over, which resulted in substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and rudder. 
 
Examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2 exhaust rocker arm stud was fractured. Metallurgical 
examination of the fracture surfaces on the rocker arm stud revealed that it had fractured due to fatigue. 
The fatigue fracture of the No. 2 exhaust rocker arm stud likely led to the loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to the fatigue fracture of the No. 2 exhaust rocker arm stud.
