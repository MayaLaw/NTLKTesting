Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, while en route to the nontowered airport, she obtained local weather 
and reported on the common traffic advisory frequency that she would be entering the downwind for 
runway 30. Another pilot in the traffic pattern reported that they were using runway 12, so the student 
turned the airplane 180° to enter the downwind for runway 12. She added that, during the landing roll, 
she applied brakes and attempted to turn right off the runway, but the "speed was still high." She 
realized that she would not be able to make the turn, so she attempted to turn left back onto the runway. 
Subsequently, the airplane skidded off the runway to the right and impacted a taxiway sign.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The deputy safety officer of the flight school reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures 
or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport’s automated weather observation station reported that, about 5 minutes before the accident, 
the wind was from 350° at 4 knots. The student landed the airplane on runway 12.
