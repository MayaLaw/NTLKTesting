Analysis 
According to the pilot in the experimental amateur-built amphibious airplane, during takeoff from a 
lake, the airplane bounced twice, but on the third bounce, the hull "gave way." Water entered the 
airplane, and the pilot exited through the canopy. 
The pilot reported that the hull had been repaired previously, but it still had "some leakage" after the 
repair. Substantial damage was sustained to the forward left side of the hull where the sponson was 
attached. 
Photographs provided by the Federal Aviation Administration showed long-term water damage to the 
plywood and fiberglass hull structure. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to take off with a known structural issue, which resulted in hull damage.
