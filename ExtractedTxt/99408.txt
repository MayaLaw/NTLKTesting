Analysis 
The pilot was conducting a training flight under the supervision of a flight instructor in a 
second airplane. Following a touch-and-go landing, the landing gear was retracted; however, 
the right main landing gear indicated unsafe. After consultation with the flight instructor, the 
pilot again attempted to lower the landing gear and then observed a normal indication that all 
three landing gear were down and locked into position. As the pilot turned onto the downwind 
leg of the traffic pattern, he noticed a hydraulic warning light. The flight instructor also noticed 
fluid streaming from the right side of the airplane. Shortly thereafter, the pilot noted low 
hydraulic pressure and it was decided he would conduct a no-flap landing, utilizing the 
remaining hydraulic pressure to boost the flight controls. Immediately upon touchdown, the 
right main landing gear collapsed. The pilot was unable to control the airplane and it veered off 
the right side of the runway before stopping. 
The right main landing gear strut was broken in two parts. Examination of the broken right 
gear components revealed small crack features consistent with a preexisting progressive crack 
at the base of the aft pivot pin bore. It is likely that the preexisting fatigue crack in the landing 
gear propagated to the point of failure. The crack also likely became large enough for hydraulic 
fluid to leak following the touch-and-go landing and failed catastrophically when the airplane 
touched down during the final landing.
