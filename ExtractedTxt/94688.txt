Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Friendly, Maryland
Accident Number:
ERA17LA100
Date & Time:
February 6, 2017, 11:00 Local 
Registration:
N21HD
Aircraft:
Piper PA32R
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
After completing a preflight inspection of the airplane, the private pilot filled the fuel tanks and sampled 
the fuel, which exhibited no anomalies. Shortly after takeoff, about 1,000 ft above ground level, the 
engine experienced a total loss of power and the airplane was substantially damaged during the 
subsequent forced landing. A postaccident examination of the engine and fuel system revealed no 
evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Although 
the timing of both magnetos was found to be off, this discrepancy could have been a result of impact 
forces, since the engine ran smoothly before the loss of power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power during initial climb for reasons that could not be determined because 
examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded 
normal operation.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
