Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped, restricted-category airplane, he had performed an 
agricultural flight and was landing to take on another load. He made a three-point landing with full flaps 
and closed the throttle. He stated that, during the landing roll, the airplane "turned violently to the right 
and got very light on the gear." The airplane’s nose had turned 45° right of the runway centerline, so he 
applied left brake and left rudder and then he added power. As the power increased, the airplane rolled 
left. The left wing struck the ground, and the pilot pulled the throttle to idle and then he applied reverse 
thrust and full brakes. However, the airplane exited the runway and collided with a drainage culvert. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing spar and aileron.
The pilot reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was light and variable, but dust devils 
were present. Additionally, he reported that the accident could have been prevented by landing at a 
higher airspeed to keep airflow over the rudder and by minimizing the engine thrust.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
