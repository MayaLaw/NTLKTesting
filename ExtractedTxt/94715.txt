Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after maneuvering in the local area for about 45 minutes, he returned to his home 
airport for landing. During the final approach, the airplane sunk below the proper glidepath, and he 
increased the power three separate times, but the airplane continued to sink. Subsequently, the airplane 
struck a seawall located about 380 ft from the runway threshold, which resulted in the propeller 
separating from the propeller hub and the collapse of the landing gear.
The fuselage and both wings sustained substantial damage.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration Aviation Safety Inspector who interviewed the pilot 
after the accident, the pilot reported that the engine did not contribute to the accident. 
Probable Cause and Findings
