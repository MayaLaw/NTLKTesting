Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot and passenger departed on a pleasure flight over the water; radar data showed that the 
airplane was at an altitude about 700 ft mean sea level. The passenger stated that she was concerned 
about how low the airplane was flying, but the pilot reassured her that they were fine and able to fly 
safely 200 ft above the water. The pilot then looked down at his tablet, which he was using for 
navigation, and the passenger saw him push the flight control yoke forward. The airplane descended and 
subsequently impacted the water and nosed over. The passenger was able to egress on her own as the 
airplane began to sink; however, the pilot appeared unconscious and did not exit the airplane.
Neither the wreckage nor the pilot's remains were recovered. Although the wreckage could not be 
examined, the passenger reported no mechanical problems with the airplane before the impact. It is 
likely that, as the pilot was looking down at his tablet, he inadvertently pushed the control yoke forward, 
causing the airplane to descend into the water. Because of his distraction in using his tablet to navigate, 
he failed to detect the descent.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the water and his distraction by using the tablet for 
navigation, which resulted in his failure to detect that the airplane had entered a descent.
