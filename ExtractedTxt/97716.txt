Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while practicing a soft-field takeoff in light wind conditions, as the nosewheel 
lifted off the runway, he released the aft pressure on the yoke. The airplane "found" ground effect, and 
"all felt normal." The airplane then began to drift left, so he applied right rudder, but the rudder input 
had little effect. The landing gear was not yet retracted, so he landed the airplane on the grass off the end 
of the runway. During the ground roll, the left wing hit a tree and went through a barbed wire fence.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 100Â° at 5 knots. The pilot departed from runway 32.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain the runway heading during a soft-field takeoff with a tailwind, which 
resulted in a rejected takeoff.
