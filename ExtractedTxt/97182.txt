Analysis 
The pilot performed a steep approach over tree-covered descending terrain to the tree-lined runway. He 
reported that, on the approach, the airplane "encountered significant low-level wind shear and sink" 
about 800 ft before the runway. He aborted the landing, but the airplane impacted the ground 150 ft 
short of the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both engine mounts and the right-wing spar. 
The AWOS located on the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 250Â° 
at 13 knots, gusting to 22 knots. The density altitude was reported as 4,000 ft, and the pilot landed on 
runway 20, which was 3,560 ft long.
The airport facility directory stated that runway 20 has a nonstandard entry due to rising terrain at the 
approach end, along with 81-ft-tall trees that were 560 ft from the approach end of the runway. 
In the recommendation section of the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot Aircraft Accident 
Report, the pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented by avoiding nonstandard or steep 
approaches to runway 20 in gusting wind conditions.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
