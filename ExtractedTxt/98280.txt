Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during approach, he was struggling to keep the airspeed at 60 to 70 
knots, so he entered a side slip and reduced the power to idle. Once assured the airplane would reach the 
runway, he aligned the airplane with the runway. The airplane landed on the left main landing gear, 
bounced, and the student performed a go-around. He entered the left traffic pattern and landed without 
further incident.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the firewall and fuselage.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 6 minutes before 
the accident, the wind was from 270Â° at 6 knots. The airplane landed on runway 33.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing.
