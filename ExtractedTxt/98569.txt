Aircraft:
Piper PA28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot stated that, shortly after takeoff for the cross-country, personal flight, the engine 
suddenly lost partial power. Subsequently, he made a forced landing to a corn field, during which the 
left main landing gear penetrated the left wing and separated from the airplane, the nose landing gear 
collapsed, and the firewall and engine mount sustained substantial damage. 
Postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal evidence of any preaccident mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The carburetor exhibited no 
external damage; however, when the air box and alternate air control were removed, a dead mouse fell 
out of the intake manifold.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power on takeoff due to restricted air flow to the engine.
