Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Houston, Texas
Accident Number:
CEN19LA015
Date & Time:
October 27, 2018, 09:15 Local 
Registration:
N3973L
Aircraft:
Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that, as the airplane approached the runway after a short local, personal 
flight, the engine lost power. The pilot checked the fuel valve, mixture, and engaged the starter, but 
engine power was not restored. The pilot stated that the airplane was "headed directly toward a concrete 
revetment on the south bank" of a creek, so he banked the airplane left, and it subsequently impacted in 
the creek.
During recovery of the airplane, the fuel selector was found in the "both" position, and the throttle, 
mixture, and carburetor heat controls were found in the "forward" (off) position. Examination of the 
wreckage revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have 
precluded normal operation.
The atmospheric conditions at the time that the engine lost power were conducive to serious icing at any 
power, moderate icing at cruise power, and serious icing at descent power. Given the evidence, it is 
likely that carburetor ice accumulated during the flight and that the pilot did apply carburetor heat, 
which resulted in a loss of all engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to apply carburetor heat while operating in an area conducive to carburetor icing, 
which resulted in a total loss of engine power on approach and subsequent forced landing into a creek.
