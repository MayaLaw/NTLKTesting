Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airline transport pilot reported that the preflight inspection, engine start, taxi, and engine run-up 
were uneventful. During initial climb for the local flight, about 400 ft above ground level, the engine 
power suddenly reduced to idle. The pilot lowered the nose of the airplane and made a shallow left turn 
to avoid trees; however, the airplane contacted power lines and came to rest upright in a parking lot. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage. Examination of the wreckage 
revealed that adequate fuel remained on board and that fuel had leaked from the airplane after impact. 
During the examination, the fuel screen was removed from the fuel servo. Although some rust was 
observed on the screen and in the servo, consistent with the airplane sitting unused over a period of time, 
it is not likely that this had any impact on the operation of the engine. Further examination of the 
airframe and engine did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that 
would have precluded normal operation. Thus, the reason for the partial loss of engine power could not 
be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power during initial climb for reasons that could not be determined because 
examination of the wreckage did not reveal any evidence of preimpact malfunctions or failures that 
would have precluded normal operation.
