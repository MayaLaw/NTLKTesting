Registration:
N451JP
Aircraft:
Vans RV6
Aircraft Damage:

Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 Fatal, 1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot and passenger were landing in gusting crosswind conditions following a local flight. The 
passenger stated that the airplane touched down on the right side of the runway, bounced several times, 
departed the right side of the runway, and subsequently nosed over; a witness on the ground also 
watched the airplane bounce, depart the runway surface, and nose over in the grass. Weather 
observations indicated a left crosswind component between 9 and 15 knots about the time of the 
accident.
Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded 
normal operation, and the accident is consistent with the pilot's failure to attain a proper landing flare in 
gusting crosswind conditions, which resulted in the bounced landing, during which he failed to conduct 
a go-around. Subsequently, he did not maintain directional control, which resulted in the runway 
departure and nose-over. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare in gusting crosswind conditions, his failure to conduct a go-around, 
and his failure to maintain directional control, which resulted in a runway departure and nose-over.
