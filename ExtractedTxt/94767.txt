Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during takeoff, the airplane encountered a

off, and the airplane impacted two trees.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and left wing.
The pilot reported there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
A review of local weather at the airfield about the time of the accident showed the wind was 300Â° at 10 
knots. The pilot was departing on runway 34.
