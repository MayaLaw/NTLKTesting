Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a max performance takeoff, he set the flaps to 10° and accelerated to 60 
mph. He pulled back and pitched the airplane for Vx (best angle climb), 52 mph, to simulate an obstacle, 
and then pitched for Vy (best rate climb), 72 mph, where he observed that the airplane was descending. 
He pitched back to gain altitude but immediately heard the stall warning horn and felt a lack of 
responsiveness in the flight controls. He leveled the airplane to touch down on the remaining runway, 
but the right wing and right horizontal stabilizer impacted the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and right horizontal stabilizer.
The pilot reported that the cause of the accident was that the published Vx airspeed was below the stall 
speed.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation but that it was possible that the engine was not performing 
at optimal performance.
The airplane owner's manual checklist titled "Maximum Performance Take-Off" stated: 
1. Wing Flaps – Up.
2. Carburetor Heat – Cold.
3. Brakes – Hold.
4. Throttle – Full "OPEN."
5. Brakes – Release.
