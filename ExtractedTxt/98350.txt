Registration:
N6469P
Aircraft:
Cessna 152
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a personal, cross-country flight. He reported that, when the airplane 
was about 12 miles from the departure airport, the engine started running roughly, and the airplane was 
"violently shaking." He decided to conduct a forced landing in a field, during which the nose landing 
gear dug into the soft ground, and the airplane flipped over. 
 
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the No. 4 cylinder exhaust valve was fractured, and 
although the head of the exhaust valve was not recovered, the fracture features on the exhaust valve stem 
were consistent with fatigue. A review of maintenance records revealed that the exhaust valves were 
installed during an overhaul of the engine about 28 years before the accident. The engine manufacturer 
recommended that the engine be overhauled every 12 years or 2,400 hours, whichever comes first.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power due to a fractured exhaust valve, which resulted in a forced 
landing on unsuitable terrain and a subsequent rollover.
