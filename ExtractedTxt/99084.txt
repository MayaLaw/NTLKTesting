Analysis 
On March 10, 2019, at 0944 eastern daylight time, PSA Airlines flight 5366, a Bombardier CRJ-
900, N569NN, collided with PSA Airlines flight 5141, a Bombardier CRJ-700, N530EA while 
pushing back from gate E31 at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport (KCLT), Charlotte, 
North Carolina. There were no injuries the passengers and crew onboard either airplane, and both 
airplanes received substantial damage. Both airplanes were regularly scheduled passenger flights 
operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121. 
The CRJ-700 had pushed back from gate E14B and was waiting for taxi by spot 29W. The CRJ-
900 requested push back from gate E31, and the north ramp controller initially instructed them to 
“10 and hold.” The push back was approved about 2 minutes later and the flight crew coordinated 
with ground crew. After pushing back about 30 feet, the tail of the CRJ-900 impacted the tail of the 
CRJ-700. After feeling the impact, the CRJ-900 crew aborted their engine start procedure and set 
the parking brake, while the CRJ-700 crew started their auxiliary power unit and shut down both 
engines after receiving damage reports from ATC and neighboring airplanes. An emergency 
evacuation was not performed on either aircraft. Post-accident examination revealed substantially 
damaged to the horizonal and vertical stabilizers and left elevator of the CRJ-900, and the 
horizontal stabilizer and left elevator of the CRJ-700.
