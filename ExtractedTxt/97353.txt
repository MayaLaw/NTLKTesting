Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that the flight was uneventful and during the approach for landing, he 
placed the landing gear handle in the down position and observed three green landing gear 
lights, indicating that the gear was down and locked. Shortly after touchdown, the nose landing 
gear collapsed into the retracted position. The airplaneâ€™s nose impacted the runway and the 
airplane skidded to a stop, resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. After the airplane 
stopped, the landing gear position lights indicated that all of the landing gear were extended 
and locked into position. A mechanic who saw the landing and assisted in removing the 
airplane from the runway after the accident reported that, during the attempt to move the 
airplane, they lifted the nose off the ground and tried unsuccessfully to move the nose landing 
gear into the down and locked position. 
Postaccident testing of the nose landing gear actuator revealed no discrepancies. Although the 
green safe switch remained illuminated during the entire testing cycle, indicating a defective 
switch, this did not directly contribute to the collapse of the nose landing gear. Review of 
maintenance records showed no nose gear discrepancies over the previous 18 months. The 
reason for the nose landing gear collapse could not be determined based on the available 
information.
