Analysis 
The pilot was departing from a private airstrip with a light tailwind present. A witness at the airstrip saw 
the airplane lift off the ground, northbound, about 1,500 ft down the runway; the airplane flew another 
500 ft before it pitched up. The airplane was about 100 ft above the ground and not climbing when it 
banked left and then turned right. The airplane nose pitched down and the airplane entered a dive and 
subsequently impacted terrain.
The airplane came to rest on its nose and its engine was embedded in terrain. Examination of the 
airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded control of the 
airplane. 
Given the available information, it is likely that the pilot failed to maintain the proper airspeed during 
the initial climb after takeoff, which resulted in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack 
and the airplane experiencing an aerodynamic stall at too low of an altitude to recover. Investigators 
were not able to determine why the airplane was on the ground for 1,500 ft before it rotated and took 
off. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain the proper airspeed during the initial climb after takeoff, which resulted in 
an exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and a stall.
