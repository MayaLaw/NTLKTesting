Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during a touch-and-go landing in crosswind conditions and with the 
student pilot on the controls, the airplane touched down on the runway centerline "but without perfect 
longitudinal (heading) alignment," and the airplane then veered left. The instructor took control of the 
airplane and added power to take off, but she did not retract any of the "partial" flaps. She maintained 
the "slightly" offset direction from the runway during the takeoff roll, and the airplane became airborne 
as it exited the left side of the runway. The left wing impacted trees and brush. Subsequently, the 
airplane came to rest at the bottom of a ravine.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 330Â° at 7 knots, gusting to 14 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 6.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to maintain the runway heading during an attempted takeoff in gusting 
crosswind conditions, which resulted in a collision with trees.
