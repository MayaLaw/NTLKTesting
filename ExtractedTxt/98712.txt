Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was flying the airplane while wearing an "air cast boot." During landing, the 
airplane decelerated, and he asked the passenger to move his feet up to the brake pedals and apply the 
brakes. He added that the passenger applied "insufficient differential brake application," and the airplane 
veered left. The passenger applied right brake and rudder to correct, but the airplane then veered right, 
exited the runway, and impacted a ditch.
The pilot reported that he was wearing the boot due to a previous injury. He added that he had the ability 
to fully manipulate both rudder controls, but the boot prevented him from being able to fully apply brake 
pressure.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to fly with an air cast boot on his foot, which led him to rely on the 
passenger to apply brakes and rudder, which was performed improperly and led to a loss of directional 
control.
