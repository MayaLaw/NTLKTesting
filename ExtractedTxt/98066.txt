Analysis 
The student pilot reported that he was flying north of the departure airport when the airplane's engine 
began running roughly. He attempted to return to the airport but was unable to reach the airport and 
landed in a cornfield. The airplane nosed over in the 7-ft-tall corn and sustained substantial damage to 
both wings. Examination of the airplane revealed that the engine's No. 3 cylinder exhaust valve was 
stuck in its valve guide, and the No. 3 exhaust valve rocker arm was fractured. A maintenance record 
entry indicated that the Nos. 1, 3, and 4 cylinders had experienced valves sticking and had been sent 
back to the overhaul vendor for service. The cylinders were reinstalled 3 days before the accident. Based 
on the available evidence, the partial loss of engine power was likely due to the No. 3 cylinder exhaust 
valve becoming stuck, which resulted in a secondary overload failure of the associated rocker arm and a 
substantial reduction in engine power output.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A stuck No. 3 cylinder exhaust valve, which resulted in failure of the associated rocker arm, a partial 
loss of engine power, and the subsequent forced landing into tall vegetation.
