Analysis 
The private pilot departed for a local personal flight in the experimental airplane that he had built and 
flown for about 500 hours. A witness saw the airplane flying about 50 feet above trees with the nose 
oscillating up and down. According to the witness, the engine was not "making any strange noises [and 
had a] steady tone." The airplane struck trees and impacted the ground about 0.75 mile south of the 
airport. 
Postaccident examination of the airframe, engine, and propeller revealed no discrepancies or anomalies 
that would have prevented normal operation.The damage to the propeller blades was consistent with 
rotation at impact. An autopsy of the pilot was not performed. According to the toxicology report, no 
ethanol or drugs were detected. Given the oscillations described by the witness, it is likely that the pilot 
did not maintain airplane control following the takeoff.   
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control after takeoff.
