Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane touched down in the first third of the 1,659-ft-long 
runway, but the airplane did not seem to slow as normal with the brakes applied. He pumped the brakes, 
but the deceleration was "less than expected." He considered performing a go around but decided to use 
maximum braking instead. With maximum braking applied, the airplane veered off the runway to the 
right and impacted a fence.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
He further reported that, following the accident, he inspected the runway and found solid skid marks 
from the right tire and broken skid marks from the left tire.
The pilot reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was light and variable and 
predominately from 280°. The automated weather observation station located about 12 miles east of the 
accident airport reported that, about 19 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 220° at 12 knots. 
The airplane landed on runway 32. 
The calculated landing roll with full flaps was 930 ft, and the landing distance over a 50-ft obstacle was 
2,020 ft. 
The manufacturer stated that "For a safe landing the landing distance available (LDA) should be at least 
equal to the landing distance of a 50 ft (15m) obstacle."
