Defining Event:
Electrical system malf/failure
Injuries:
3 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Two instrument-rated commercial pilots and one passenger were conducting a cross-country flight in 
instrument meteorological conditions when they began discussing an electrical malfunction; they then 
reported the electrical problem to air traffic control. The airplane subsequently made a descending right 
turn and impacted wooded terrain at a high speed. Most components of the airplane were highly 
fragmented, impact damaged, and unidentifiable.
Based on the limited discussion of the electrical problem on the cockpit voice recorder and the damage 
to the airplane, it was not possible to determine the specific nature of the electrical malfunction the 
airplane may have experienced. While it was not possible to determine which systems were impacted by 
the electrical malfunction, it is possible the flight instruments were affected. The airplane's descending, 
turning, flight path before impact is consistent with a system malfunction that either directly or 
indirectly (through a diversion of attention) led to the pilot's loss of  awareness of the airplane's 
performance in instrument meteorological conditions and subsequent loss of control of the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An unidentified electrical system malfunction that led to the pilots losing awareness of the 
airplane's performance in instrument meteorological conditions and resulted in a loss of 
control of the airplane.
