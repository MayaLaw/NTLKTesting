Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during the landing with the student pilot on the flight controls, about 
5 to 10 ft above the ground, a wind gust caused the airplane to drift right. The instructor assumed control 
of the airplane, attempted to correct, applied full power, and initiated a go-around. The instructor stated 
that the airplane was "low and slow," and the left main landing gear contacted the runway, and the 
airplane drifted left. Concerned the airplane would not gain significant altitude to clear the buildings in 
the flightpath, the instructor chose to land in the grass left of the runway. Subsequently, the airplane 
encountered soft terrain and nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the aft fuselage and rudder.
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
About the time of the accident, the airport's automated weather observation station reported that the 
wind was from 170Â° at 5 knots. The student was landing the airplane on runway 16.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain the runway heading and the flight instructor's delayed remedial 
action during landing, which resulted in the instructor landing the airplane in grass left of the runway 
and a subsequent nose-over.
