flew the airplane toward his home; the airplane struck a garage across the street and 
continued until it impacted the front of his home. An examination of the airplane found no 
anomalies with the flight controls that would have contributed to the accident. Toxicology 
testing revealed the presence of a medication used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder, some eating disorders, and panic attacks; the pilot did not report the use of this 
medication to the Federal Aviation Administration. The pilot had a known history of 
depression, anxiety, and anger management issues. The circumstances of the accident were
