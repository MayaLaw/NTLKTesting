Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while landing in a crosswind, the tailwheel-equipped biplane was "thrusted 
downward violently" and landed hard. He added that the biplane then veered right off the runway. He 
then attempted a go-around, but after applying power, realized the need for full left aileron to maintain 
heading. He decided to abort the go-around and reduced power to land. During the landing, he used 
brakes to avoid airport signs in the landing path, the right main tire "got some traction," and the biplane 
ground looped to the right. 
The biplane sustained substantial damage to both lower wings and the elevator.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the biplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind was from 110째 at 15 knots and that terrain-induced moderate turbulence 
existed. The automated weather observation system at the airport reported the following about the time 
of the accident: temperature 88째F, dew point 75째F, visibility 10 miles, wind from 110째 at 11 knots, and a 
broken layer of clouds at 2,800 ft. The pilot was landing the biplane on runway 18L.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a crosswind landing.
