Analysis 
The private pilot stated that, before departure for a cross-country, personal flight at night in visual conditions, 
he checked the weather using several online weather resources, which showed that the destination airport was 
reporting visual meteorological conditions. He reported that, about 30 minutes before the anticipated arrival at 
the destination airport, it started snowing. He descended the airplane to get out of the snow, but the airplane 
encountered a temperature inversion, and because snow was accumulating on the wings, the pilot chose to 
divert to the closest airport. He approached the runway at a higher-than-normal speed, and the airplane 
ballooned during touchdown and then drifted off the side of the runway. He attempted a go-around, but the 
airplane could not gain enough airspeed to become airborne, and it subsequently impacted two trucks, which 
resulted in substantial damage to the airframe. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have 
precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilot's improper landing flare resulted in the airplane ballooning 
upon landing and led to his subsequent loss of directional control.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in the airplane ballooning on touchdown, and his subsequent 
failure to maintain directional control during the attempted landing and subsequent go-around.
