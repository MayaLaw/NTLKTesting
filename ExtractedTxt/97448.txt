Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a touch-and-go landing in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, he 
felt an "unusual mechanical sensation," but was able to maintain directional control and 
continued the takeoff. During his second landing approach, the airplane “aggressively 
weathercocked” into the wind on short final approach and the airplane touched down tailwheel 
first. During the landing roll, the airplane started to veer left, and the pilot was unable to 
correct with rudder input. The airplane continued off the left side of the runway and nosed 
over, resulting in substantial damage. 
After the accident, the pilot noted that the left rudder spring had disconnected from the arm of 
the steerable tailwheel and the safety wire was missing. The pilot reconnected the spring before 
the airplane could be examined; whether the tailwheel spring contributed to the loss of control 
could not be determined.
The recorded weather conditions about the time of the accident included a left quartering 
tailwind at 6 knots with gusts to 13 knots for the landing runway.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during landing in gusting crosswind conditions for 
reasons that could not be determined based on the available information.
