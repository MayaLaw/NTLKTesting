Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during an approach to runway 22, the airplane drifted to the right of the runway 
centerline. He initiated a go-around by turning off the carburetor heat, applying full throttle, decreasing 
the flaps from 30째 to 20째, and pushing forward on the yoke to increase airspeed; the airplane then began 
to settle into ground effect. The pilot saw that the terrain began to rise, and he recalled that the noise 
abatement procedure called for a right turn to 270째, so he turned to the right before establishing a climb. 
The airplane descended into rising terrain, struck trees, and impacted the ground and became engulfed in 
flames. The postcrash fire destroyed the fuselage.
The METAR reported that the wind was variable at 4 knots and that the temperature was 84째F. The field 
elevation was 5,504 ft, and the altimeter setting was 30.14 inches of mercury. The density altitude was 
8,255 ft.
Per the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot Aircraft Accident Report, the pilot reported that the 
accident could have been prevented by reviewing the airplane's performance data and atmospheric 
conditions, especially density altitude and its effect on performance per the manufacturer's Pilot's 
Operating Handbook. The pilot stated that he would place greater emphasis on performance planning as 
an essential activity during flight planning. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
