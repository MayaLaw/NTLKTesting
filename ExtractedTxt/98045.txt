Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during takeoff, the right wing lifted 
"unexpectedly." He attempted to recover, but the left main landing gear sideloaded and collapsed. The

The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 7 minutes before 
the accident, the wind was from 320° at 14 knots. The airplane was departing from runway 21.
