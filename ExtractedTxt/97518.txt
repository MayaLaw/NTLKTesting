Analysis 
The pilot stated that after takeoff, the engine lost partial power, and the airplane would not maintain 
altitude. The pilot initiated a forced landing to a runway at a nearby closed airport. During the descent, 
the pilot verified the mixture was full rich and the carburetor heat was off, and he switched fuel tanks. 
The pilot said the engine did not respond, so he turned it off and executed a "forward slip" and S-turns to 
position the airplane onto the runway; however, the airplane landed about 600 ft from the departure end 
of the runway, overran the end of the runway, and struck a fence which resulted in substantial damage to 
the wings and fuselage. The pilot reported he believed that the recently replaced fuel selector valve 
failed and starved the engine of fuel. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane and an engine test run did not reveal any anomalies with the 
engine, fuel system or the fuel selector valve that would have precluded normal operation. Thus, the 
reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power for undetermined reasons because postaccident examination of the engine and 
fuel system did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation, which led to the 
pilotâ€™s forced landing and subsequent runway overshoot and collision with a fence.
