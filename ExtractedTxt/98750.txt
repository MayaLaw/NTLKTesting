Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the initial engine start, he "cranked the engine several times," but the 
engine would not start. He then pumped the throttle about six times, and in a "split second," the engine 
surged to full rpm. He added that, despite fully applying the brakes, the airplane crossed over a ridge and 
went down an embankment. Subsequently, the airplane entered a parking lot, the left wing struck a lamp 
post, the airplane spun left, and it impacted another lamp post.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
