Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during a simulated engine failure in the traffic pattern, with gusting 
wind conditions, the student pilot entered a forward slip on final approach. He added that 10 to 20 ft 
above the runway surface, "the wind gust we were riding suddenly halted wherein the aircraft began a 
rapid downward descent." The flight instructor reported that he "went for the flight controls to take 
command," but the student pilot at that same time applied back pressure on the flight controls. 
Subsequently, the airplane touched down hard, bounced, and the flight instructor performed a go-
around. The flight instructor completed the subsequent traffic pattern and landing without further 
incident.
The engine mounts and firewall sustained substantial damage. 
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
An automated weather observation station at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 170Â° at 16 knots, gusting to 24 knots. The flight instructor reported that the landing was 
on runway 15.
