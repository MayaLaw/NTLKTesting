Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during final approach, the airplane required 
about 10° of crab to the right to maintain alignment with the runway. During the landing flare, he 
reduced power to idle, slowly applied rudder to align the fuselage with the runway centerline, and added 
right aileron to counter the crosswind. He added that, during the three-point landing, the airplane 
bounced. During the landing roll, he had full right aileron countering the wind when a "perceived" gust 
lifted the right wing. He held full right aileron, full aft yoke, and used the rudder to maintain alignment. 
Subsequently, about 40 knots groundspeed, the left main landing gear collapsed, and the left wing 
impacted the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and aileron.
The pilot reported that the left main landing gear detached from the airplane.
The automated weather observation system located at the accident airport reported that, about 20 
minutes before the accident, the wind was from 110° at 8 knots, gusting to 19 knots. The same 
observation system reported that, about 10 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 150° at 13 
knots, gusting to 21 knots. The pilot landed on runway 4R.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing in gusting tailwind conditions.
