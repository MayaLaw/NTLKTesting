Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that had just finished rebuilding the airplane and was conducting a local, personal 
flight, which was the airplane’s first flight since an accident 5 years earlier. While returning to land on a 
grass strip and shortly after switching from the right to the left tank, the engine began to run roughly and 
“sputter.” The pilot added that the airplane was “high and fast” on the approach but that he chose to 
continue the landing due to the engine problem. Upon landing, the airplane bounced, the nosewheel hit 
the ground hard and collapsed, and the airplane then nosed over and came to rest inverted. 
Postaccident engine examination revealed no evidence off mechanical malfunctions or failures that 
would have precluded normal operation. The pilot reported that the airplane had an adequate amount of 
fuel onboard when the engine lost power. He added that the quick fuel disconnect on the left wing fuel 
tank was loose before the flight, so he reconnected the fitting and speculated that air might have entered 
the lines when he reconnected the fitting and led to the engine sputtering when he switched tanks. The 
reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined based on the available information.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons, and the pilot’s failure to maintain proper control 
of the airplane, which led to a hard, bounced landing.
