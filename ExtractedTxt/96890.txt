Analysis 
The flight instructor, acting as a safety pilot, in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, to expedite 
takeoff, he decided to take off from the grass runway instead of the concrete runway. He added that, 
about midway into the soft-field takeoff roll, he observed that the airplane was "struggling to build 
airspeed." He added that the runway had previously thawed and was "wet spongy sod." He reduced 
power and began to apply the brakes to abort the takeoff, but the airplane overran the runway, impacted 
a snow bank, and nosed over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's delayed aborted takeoff on a soft, wet, grass runway, which resulted in a runway 
overrun.
