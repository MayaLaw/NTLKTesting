Analysis 
The pilot was transporting about 120 lbs of plywood, secured to the airplane's float struts via cargo 
straps, to his remote cabin. The pilot reported that, about 200 ft above the ground during the landing 
approach, the airplane experienced an uncommanded left turn, then the pilot realized that he had no 
rudder control and that the rudder was "locked to the left." The airplane subsequently impacted trees and 
terrain. The pilot reported no mechanical anomalies with the engine and no anomalies with the airplane 
before the loss of control.
The airplane's water rudder cables descend from the fuselage along the support struts to which the 
plywood was secured. The water rudders were directly linked to the rudder. It is likely that, during the 
flight, the plywood shifted and interfered with the water rudder cable, which resulted in the pilot's loss 
of rudder control during the landing approach.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to properly secure the external load, which resulted in the load shifting during flight, 
interference with the water rudder cable, and a subsequent loss of control
