Registration:
N825PW
Aircraft:
Just JA30 SUPERSTOL
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting a local flight. An airport surveillance camera captured the accident 
airplane departing from the runway and entering a nose high left turn. Shortly thereafter, the 
airplane's bank angle decreased, and its left yaw increased, and the airplane began to descend. 
A few seconds later, the airplane banked to the left, and entered a nose-low attitude just before 
impact with the ground.  
Examination of the engine and the airframe revealed no preaccident anomalies that would 
have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilot exceeded the airplane's critical angle 
of attack during the initial climb, which resulted in an inadvertent stall and spin at an altitude 
too low to recover.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilotâ€™s exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during the initial climb after 
takeoff, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and spin.
