Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot and a safety pilot were practicing instrument maneuvers, approaches, and landings at different 
airports during the flight. The airplane entered the traffic pattern for a practice landing at an airport. 
According to the safety pilot, the airplane was high and slow during the final approach. About 10 ft 
above ground level, the airplane "floated a little longer," and the pilot initiated a go-around by applying 
full throttle. During the attempted go-around, both occupants applied conflicting "correction" inputs to 
the control yokes; the pilot applied back pressure, and the safety pilot applied forward pressure. The 
airplane stalled, the left wing impacted terrain, and the airplane came to rest upright adjacent to the 
runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage and both wings.
Both pilots reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot statements were conflicting regarding the accident details and sequence of events. Based on 
the statements and airplane damage, it is likely that the conflicting control inputs resulted in the pilots' 
failure to maintain a proper airspeed and that the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall during the 
attempted go-around. Neither pilot reported that verbal communication was established during the 
landing sequence.
