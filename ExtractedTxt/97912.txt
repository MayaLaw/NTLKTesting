Analysis 
The pilot reported that rain showers were present near his destination airport, so he diverted and landed 
at a nearby airport. He added that, during the approach, he felt the airplane was being pushed forward 
and saw an increase in indicated airspeed and nose-down attitude. He continued the approach, and upon 
touchdown, the airplane landed hard on the nosewheel first and bounced, so he initiated a go-around. He 
then re-entered the pattern, approached the same runway, and upon touchdown, the nose landing gear 
(NLG) collapsed, and airplane exited the runway to the left into a ditch. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the NLG tunnel. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station (AWOS) reported that, about 7 minutes before the 
accident, the wind was from 100Â° at 7 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 32.
The pilot reported that he believed the NLG was damaged during the initial landing. He added that, after 
landing, the windsock was found to be damaged and that it was not indicating the wind direction 
properly. However, the airport's AWOS was accessible by radio.
