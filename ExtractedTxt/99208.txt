Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, after landing, she and the flight instructor requested to taxi back to the 
runway for traffic pattern practice. They were instructed to taxi to the runway at a taxiway intersection. 
They complied and lined up behind another aircraft holding short of the runway. She added that, while 
stopped and waiting for a takeoff clearance, she felt the airplane shake. She turned around and saw that 
another airplane had struck their airplane's vertical stabilizer and rudder.
The solo student pilot in the other airplane reported that, after landing, during taxi from the runway to 
parking, he saw an airplane holding short of the runway at a taxiway intersection. He thought there was 
enough clearance to taxi around the airplane, but his airplane's left wing struck the stopped airplane.
The stopped airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and rudder.
The student pilot of the stopped airplane and the flight school manager for the taxiing airplane reported 
that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with either of the airplanes that 
would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain adequate clearance from the stopped airplane while attempting to 
taxi around it.
