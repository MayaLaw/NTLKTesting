Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, after conducting two touch-and-go landings at 
a nearby airport, he decided to land at a different airport to speak with a friend. He added that everything 
seemed normal during the touchdown on the snow-covered runway but that the airplane then "abruptly 
stopped and [nosed] over." 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the rudder.
The pilot reported that the inside of the left main landing gear and brake was "packed with ice" and had 
frozen, which prevented the wheel from rotating during the landing roll.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The contamination of snow and ice on the left main landing gear and brake, which prevented the wheel 
from rolling during touchdown and resulted in a nose-over.
