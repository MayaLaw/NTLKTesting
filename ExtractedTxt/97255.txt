Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after three attempts to land the airplane at the one-way, private grass airstrip, the 
wind had become a tailwind. During the fourth approach, the wind was "apparently stabilized," but once 
he committed to land, the wind increased and became a hazard. He added that the airplane was then "too 
low to abort," and the airplane landed long. Subsequently, the airplane was unable to stop, overran the 
runway, and impacted a power pole.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system about 9 nautical miles away from the accident site reported 
that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 220Â° at 5 knots. The pilot landed the airplane to 
the east.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper approach in tailwind conditions, which resulted in long landing and subsequent 
runway overrun.
