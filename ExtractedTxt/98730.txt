Analysis 
The pilot reported that during a pleasure flight over a lake, about 700 ft above ground level, the engine 
started to shake and subsequently lost all power. The pilot attempted to restart the engine by turning the 
auxiliary fuel pump on, and he dove the airplane toward the water so that the windmilling propeller 
would help to restart the engine. The engine started, but the pilot estimated that it was only producing 
about 50% power. The pilot thought that he might be able to maintain or gain some altitude to reach a 
nearby runway; however, during the climb, the engine lost all power again. The pilot then initiated a 
forced landing to the lake. 
Witnesses around the lake reported seeing the airplane flying at low altitude. One witness stated that the 
engine sounded normal but that the airplane was flying erratically. Another witness saw the airplane 
about 40 ft above the water. He did not hear any unusual noises emanating from the engine.
The airplane and engine remained submerged in the lake for about 3 weeks before recovery. The right 
wing was not recovered. Cursory examination of the engine revealed continuity to the accessory drive 
when the propeller was rotated by hand; however, the examination was insufficient to determine 
whether or for what reason a loss of engine power may have occurred. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Impact with a lake for undetermined reasons.
