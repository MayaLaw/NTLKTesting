Analysis 
On April 11, 2019, about 2316 eastern daylight time, United Airlines flight 2260, a Boeing 737-
924, N31412, the aft galley oven dislodged during landing at Southwest Florida International

attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating 
under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 as a regularly scheduled 
passenger flight from the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (KIAH), Houston, Texas, to 
KRSW.  
After touchdown on runway 24, the aft galley oven became dislodged, and the aft galley flight 
attendant attempted to restrain it causing her injury. After taxiing to the gate and deplaning, 
the flight attendant was treated by emergency medical personnel and transported to the 
hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured left forearm. 
Post flight examination found multiple attach screws on the bottom of the oven were missing, 
which allowed the oven to slide out of its compartment during the landing. Subsequent to the 
accident, the operator conducted a fleet inspection of the oven housing attach screws.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
missing attach screws on the aft galley oven, which allowed it to become dislodged landing,
