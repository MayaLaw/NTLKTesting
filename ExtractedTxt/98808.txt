Analysis 
On December 26, 2018, KoreanAir flight 0753, an Airbus A220-300, registration HL8314, 
experienced a commanded inflight shutdown of the left (No. 1) engine, a Pratt & Whitney 
(P&W) PW1521G-3, while climbing through 29,000 feet on a flight from Busan, Korea (PUS) to 
Nagoya, Japan.  The flight crew reported hearing a loud bang that was followed by vibrations 
and an engine fire warning.  The flight crew shut down the engine and the airplane returned to 
PUS without further incident.  The engine was removed from the airplane and shipped to 
P&W’s Columbus Engine Center, Columbus, Georgia for disassembly and examination.  
The examination of the engine revealed one low pressure turbine (LPT) stage 3 blade, No. 52, 
that had a flat, planar, elliptical-shaped fracture surface at the rear half of the blade.  The 
metallurgical examination of blade No. 52 showed that the grain size and hardness conformed 
to the requirements for the specified IN-100 nickel alloy.  The energy dispersive spectroscopy 
(EDS) of blade No. 52 away from the origin of the fatigue crack produced a spectra that was 
consistent with the requirements for IN-100.  However, the EDS of blade No. 52 at the 
preexisting intergranular crack and the origin of the fatigue crack produced a spectra that was 
consistent with IN-100, but also had peaks of zirconium and hafnium.
Arconic suggested the elevated level of zirconium that was noted in the EDS could be from the 
zirconia crucible in which the nickel alloy was melted. Since all of the blades from this engine 
and many others were cast from nickel alloy melted in a zirconia crucible and the Korean Air 
event was the only IN-100 LPT stage 3 blade fracture, that would suggest the elevated level of 
zirconium noted in the EDS of LPT stage 3 blade No. 52 was probably not a major factor in the 
failure of the blade.  Hafnium is not one of the alloying elements in IN-100.  It is however, one 
of the alloying elements of MAR-M-247, which according to Arconic’s records was the alloy 
that had been melted in the crucible just prior to it being used to melt the IN-100 nickel alloy 
to cast the blades that included the LPT stage 3 blade that would become No. 52.  Arconic also 
suggested that the presence of the hafnium could be from the incomplete cleaning of the
