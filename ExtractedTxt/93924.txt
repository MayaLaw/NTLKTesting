Analysis 
The 73-year-old commercial pilot was on the fourth and final leg of a 950-mile round trip same day 
flight. As the airplane neared the airport, the pilot was told by the air traffic controller to expect runway 
25 for landing. After the controller informed him of a delay for that runway, the pilot stated that he 
could accept runway 16L; the pilot was told to proceed for runway landing, but the runway was not 
specified, an instruction which he acknowledged. Shortly after establishing contact with the tower 
controller, who instructed the pilot to continue for runway 25, the pilot reported that the airplane was on 
a downwind leg for landing on runway 16L. The controller acknowledged and, rather than correcting the 
pilot, instructed him to continue inbound for 16L. At the time, runway 16R was being used for landing 
by two Boeing 757 (B757) airplanes in sequence, separated from each other by about 7 miles. The 
controller advised the accident pilot that a B757 was on a 9-mile final for runway 16R and cautioned 
him about wake turbulence, then cleared the accident airplane to land. Shortly thereafter, the pilot 
reported that he had "the airliner" in sight. At this time, one of the B757s was on a short final approach 
for 16R, about 4.5 miles ahead of and below the accident airplane. The other B757, which was the 
potential conflict, was about 5 miles away from the accident airplane at its 2-to-3-o'clock position. 
Given that the pilot's attention was likely focused toward the runway during this portion of the approach, 
it is likely that he misidentified the ATC-reported traffic as the B757 on short final, which landed soon 
after and likely resulted in the pilot relaxing his vigilance in looking for traffic. Shortly thereafter, the 
controller issued an all-aircraft advisory that the wind was from 250Â° at 17 knots with gusts to 20 knots. 
Although these wind conditions met or exceeded the airplane's maximum demonstrated crosswind 
capability for a landing on 16L, and the airplane was still well-positioned to revert to an approach to 
runway 25, the pilot continued toward 16L.
About 70 seconds after the pilot reported sighting the traffic, just after turning the airplane onto the base 
leg of the traffic pattern, the B757 passed about 1 mile ahead of and about 100 ft below the accident 
airplane. The investigation was unable to determine whether the pilot saw that B757, or if he did, 
whether he was cognizant of the potential for a wake vortex encounter and the flight path alterations
