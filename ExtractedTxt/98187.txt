Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that he had been flying for about 1 hour and was returning to the airport 
when the engine lost total power while the airplane was about 1,000 ft above ground level (agl). 
Although the engine momentarily regained power twice, for about 3 seconds each time when he used the 
manual fuel pump, the airplane continued to lose altitude. He attempted to land on a road but was unable 
to properly align the airplane's flightpath with the road. The airplane stalled about 20 ft agl, contacted 
the road, and bounced before coming to rest in an adjacent field, which resulted in substantial damage to 
the left wing. A postaccident engine examination did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available evidence.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
