Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that she initiated the takeoff at the beginning of the runway to use all 3,500 
ft of available runway. She added that the flight controls were free and correct and that she applied 
power with the control yoke full aft for a "soft field" takeoff. The airplane "seemed" to become airborne 
earlier than normal, and during the initial climb, the nose of the airplane wanted to pitch up slightly. She 
applied "some" nose-down trim and pushed the yoke forward "slightly," and the airplane continued to 
climb. As the airspeed increased, the airplane's pitch attitude increased; she then applied full nose-down 
trim and full forward yoke and asked for help from her student. She then reduced the engine power to 
idle, performed an emergency landing, and the airplane came to rest in the trees.
A postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no mechanical failures or malfunctions 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of pitch control for an undetermined reason, which resulted in a collision with terrain during an 
emergency landing.
