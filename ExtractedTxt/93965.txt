Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was performing a low approach with full flaps about 30 feet above the 
runway. He further reported that when the airplane was about 60 feet from the end of the runway, he 
started to add power to go-around, but the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall. Subsequently, the nose 
of the airplane "suddenly" dropped, the airplane impacted the terrain, and stopped on the remaining 
runway surface.  
The fuselage and both wings sustained substantial damage. 
The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle-of-attack while maneuvering at low 
altitude, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
