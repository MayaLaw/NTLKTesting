Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that he asked the pilot receiving instruction to simulate a power-off 
emergency landing with a 180º turn to the runway and directed her to "lower the gear when landing was 
assured." After initiating the power-off approach, the pilot receiving instruction turned the airplane from 
the downwind leg onto the base leg of the traffic pattern and extended the landing gear. The sink rate 
increased, and she attempted to correct with full engine power, but the airplane continued to 
descend. The airplane landed short of the runway and struck a ground lighting system. The pilot 
receiving instruction then initiated a go-around and landed without further incident.  
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.  
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport’s automated weather observation station reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 080° at 8 knots. The airplane landed on runway 09.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot receiving instruction's failure to maintain a proper approach path and her delayed go-around 
during a simulated emergency landing, which resulted in landing short of the runway. Contributing to 
the accident was the flight instructor's failure to properly monitor the student's approach.
