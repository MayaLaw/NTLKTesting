Analysis 
During the climb after takeoff the engine lost partial power. The pilot performed troubleshooting steps 
and initiated a return to the airport. The airplane was not able to maintain altitude and landed in trees 
about 300 ft short of the approach end of the runway.
Postaccident examination revealed sooting signatures on the spark plug electrodes and inner surfaces of 
the exhaust pipe, indicating an excessively rich fuel-to-air mixture. Examination of the carburetor 
revealed multiple maintenance-related discrepancies, including an incorrectly adjusted float and a loose 
carburetor bowl. The discrepancies likely resulted in mixture irregularities and a loss of engine power.
Maintenance instructions and a series of service bulletins had been published by the carburetor 
manufacturer to address these issues. The discrepancies appeared to have been present for a while and 
were likely present at the time of the last annual inspection. The carburetor had not been overhauled or 
serviced in at least 19 years even though the manufacturer recommended overhaul at 10-year intervals.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power due to an improperly maintained carburetor.
