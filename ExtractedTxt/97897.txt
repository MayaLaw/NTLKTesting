Analysis 
The private pilot was landing the airplane on the runway at an ultralight airfield. After the airplane 
touched down, the left main landing gear (MLG) collapsed at the bottom end of the strut. The airplane 
ground looped, and the right wingtip struck the ground. The pilot stated that the landing was smooth and 
gentle, not hard, and that there was no side load on the landing gear at touchdown. He added that he 
suspected that a previous landing may have been hard, which resulted in a crack in the landing gear. 
An examination of the left MLG revealed that the upper/outer strut tubing was broken, and the 
lower/inner strut tubing was bent. There was no evidence of fatigue. It could not be determined if the 
crack occurred as a result of the accident or was preexisting.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the left main landing gear for reasons that could not be determined, which resulted in a 
loss of directional control during the ground roll. 
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
