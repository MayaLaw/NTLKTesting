Zenair ZENITH CH 750

Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Before takeoff, the private pilot completed a preflight inspection, engine start, and two engine run-ups 
with no anomalies noted. Shortly after takeoff, when the airplane was about 400 ft above ground level, 
the engine began to vibrate, and the pilot noticed a partial loss of power. He suspected carburetor icing 
and applied carburetor heat but observed no change to the engine power. Due to the low altitude, the 
pilot chose to execute a forced landing to a field. The airplane touched down in the soft field, and the 
nose gear collapsed. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane, which included the fuel system, revealed no evidence of 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot 
reported that he should have applied carburetor heat before takeoff to clear any potential ice buildup 
during the taxi and subsequent engine run-ups. The airplane was operating in an area with weather 
conditions conducive to the formation of serious carburetor ice at glide power settings. Thus, the partial 
loss of engine power was likely due to an accumulation of carburetor ice while operating at reduced 
engine power settings before takeoff.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The accumulation of carburetor ice before takeoff, which resulted in a partial loss of engine power on 
initial climb and a forced landing on unsuitable terrain.
