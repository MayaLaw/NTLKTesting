Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Atchison, Kansas
Accident Number:
CEN18LA350
Date & Time:
August 22, 2018, 16:00 Local 
Registration:
N78417
Aircraft:
Cessna A188
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was conducting agricultural application operations. He reported that, after topping 
off the airplane with fuel and flying two loads, on the third takeoff, the airplane "would not come off the 
ground." He checked the engine controls, then dumped the load in an unsuccessful attempt to become 
airborne before the end of the runway. The airplane continued off the runway and impacted terrain, 
which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. The airplane owner witnessed the 
attempted takeoff and reported that the engine puffed black smoke during the takeoff run. He added that 
the fuel servo provided a mixture that was too rich, so the pilots would reduce the mixture on the ground 
and then use a full rich mixture for takeoff. A visual examination of the engine did not reveal any 
evidence of anomalies. Although the appearance of black smoke from the engine is consistent with an 
overly rich fuel mixture, based on the information provided by the pilot and no anomalies found during 
the engine examination, the reason for the partial loss of engine power could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined during the 
postaccident examination.
