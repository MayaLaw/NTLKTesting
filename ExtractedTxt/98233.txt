Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the approach, the tower controller instructed him to stay "high and close." 
Once he turned to final, he reduced the power, and the airplane began rapidly descending. He added that 
he applied some power and back pressure to arrest the descent rate as he began to flare, but the airplane 
landed hard and faster than normal. As the nose landing gear touched down, he applied reverse thrust 
and braked aggressively. Subsequently, the nose landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest on 
the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and engine mount.
The pilot reported that postaccident examination revealed that a nose landing gear actuator bolt had 
sheared off. 
The pilot reported that the primary cause of the accident was his failure to maintain a stabilized 
approach, which resulted in a hard landing and higher-than-normal ground speed upon touchdown.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's unstabilized approach and hard landing, which resulted in a nose landing gear collapse.
