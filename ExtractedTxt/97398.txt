Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, after demonstrating a simulated emergency landing, he taxied the 
airplane off the runway and prepared to back taxi for departure. While taxiing, the instructor and student 
monitored the right-wing tip clearance to the overgrown brush on the right side of the runway, but the 
right wing became entangled, and the airplane veered right. The instructor added left rudder and brake, 
but the airplane impacted a ditch. 
Postaccident examination revealed that the right wing struck a tree and sustained substantial damage.
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to maintain adequate clearance from overgrown brush during taxi, which 
resulted in entanglement with the brush and a subsequent impact with a tree.
