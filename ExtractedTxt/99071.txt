Analysis 
The student pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while practicing takeoff and landings, 
the airplane landed hard with "a big bounce," and the right wing came up. He attempted to correct by 
adding power and initiating a go-around. Subsequently, the airplane ground looped, exited the runway, 
and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The airport's automated weather reporting station reported that, about 15 minutes after the accident, the 
wind was from 300Â° at 5 knots and that visibility was 10 statute miles. The pilot landed the airplane on 
runway 26.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard, bounced landing, and his subsequent 
failure to maintain directional control, which resulted in a runway excursion and ground loop.
