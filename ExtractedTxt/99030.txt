Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Devine, Texas
Accident Number:
CEN19LA087
Date & Time:
February 27, 2019, 16:38 Local 
Registration:
N1778
Aircraft:
Warner Aerocraft Space Walker II
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting a personal fight over his private airstrip when the airplane collided with trees 
while in a descent to make a low pass over the runway. The forward fuselage and left wing sustained 
substantial damage during the accident. 
The pilot does not recall the final portion of the flight besides a brief memory of the airplane descending 
toward trees in a 90° nose-down pitch attitude. The pilot does not recall if the airplane had any 
mechanical malfunctions during the flight. A witness reported hearing a reduction in engine power 
shortly before the accident; however, based on the pilot’s statement, it is likely that he had reduced 
engine power to descend toward the runway for a low pass.
Additionally, an examination of the airplane and its engine did not reveal any evidence of mechanical 
malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. Based upon the pilot’s recollection that the 
airplane was in a vertical nose-down descent, it is likely the airplane exceeded its critical angle of attack 
while maneuvering near the runway, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and collision with trees and 
terrain.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to maintain control of the airplane while maneuvering at a low altitude, which 
resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall.
