Accident Number:
ANC18LA069
Date & Time:
September 3, 2018, 13:53 Local 
Registration:
N3957X
Aircraft:
Piper PA32
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while in level cruise flight, the engine rpm began to increase. Shortly after 
reducing the manifold pressure in an effort to correct for the high RPM, he noticed the engine oil 
pressure drop with oil visible on the airplaneâ€™s windscreen, followed by a total loss of engine power. He 
performed an emergency landing near the high tide line in an area of seagrass. During the emergency 
landing the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and left wing.
Examination of the engine revealed a large fracture hole at the Nos. 4- and 5-cylinder pads. The Nos. 4 
and 5 connecting rods were fragmented, and pieces of the connecting rods and a large amount of metal 
debris was located within the engine. A large amount of metal contamination was present in the oil 
suction screen. The Nos.  4 and 5 connecting rods and rod bearing journals exhibited extensive 
mechanical damage and signatures consistent with exposure to extreme high heat.  
The damage to the internal engine components, the large amount of metal contamination in the oil 
screen, and the significant metal debris inside the engine were all consistent with a catastrophic engine 
failure due to a lack of lubrication. The source of the interruption of oil circulation to the engine could 
not be determined after engine disassembly.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power due to oil starvation after an interruption of oil circulation for reasons that 
could not be determined based on the available evidence.
