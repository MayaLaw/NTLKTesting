Piper PA28R

Loss of engine power (total)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and private pilot receiving instruction completed a touch-and-go landing in night 
visual meteorological conditions. During the initial climb, they heard a "loud tick" noise, then the low 
vacuum annunciator light illuminated. About 350 to 400 ft above ground level, the engine lost all power, 
and the propeller came to a complete stop. The flight instructor took control of the airplane and 
performed a forced landing to a nearby field, during which the airplane sustained substantial damage to 
the wings and aft fuselage. 
Examination revealed that the oil filler cap was not secured, and that the engine contained about 1 quart 
of oil. In addition, oil was splattered on the inside of the engine compartment. It is likely that the pilots 
failed to secure the oil filler cap during the preflight inspection, which resulted in the loss of engine oil 
inflight, eventual oil starvation, and the total loss of engine power.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilots' inadequate preflight inspection, which failed to ensure that the oil filler cap was secured and 
resulted in oil starvation and a total loss of engine power.
