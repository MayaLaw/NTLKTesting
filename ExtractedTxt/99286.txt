Analysis 
A witness saw the airplane complete a touch-and-go landing and depart toward the north. Another 
witness saw the airplane flying north after takeoff, then shortly thereafter saw it flying south as if the 
pilot was returning to the airport for landing; the airplane then made an "abrupt or severe" 180° left turn 
back toward the north before it rolled onto its right side for several seconds, then "went straight down" 
and subsequently impacted terrain. 
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. Examination of the airframe revealed that flight control continuity was confirmed throughout 
the airplane from the pilot controls to the control surfaces, with the exception of the elevator torque tube, 
which was fractured and observed to have separated near the elevator pitch servo. Metallurgical 
examination indicated that the fracture was consistent with bending overstress. It could not be 
determined if the fracture occurred prior to or during the impact sequence. It is most likely that the pilot 
experienced a loss of control during an aggressive maneuver at too low an altitude to recover from. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to maintain aircraft control during an aggressive maneuver that resulted in a 
nose down collision with terrain.
