Analysis 
The private pilot was taxiing to the ramp after an uneventful landing when the airplane did not respond 
to his application of brakes. The airplane subsequently departed the taxiway and entered a grass median, 
where the right wing impacted a lighted taxiway sign. The airplane was not equipped with nosewheel 
steering and relied on differential brake input to steer the airplane while on the ground. A postaccident 
examination noted that the brake pads for both main landing gear were worn excessively, which allowed 
brake fluid to leak past their respective O-ring seals when the brake pedals were depressed. 
Additionally, the right main tire was deflated and exhibited rotational scoring where the wheel rim had 
contacted the tire. It is likely that the right main tire deflated during taxi and the pilot was unable to 
adequately maintain directional control due to the excessively worn brake pads.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inability to maintain directional control during taxi due to excessively worn brake pads and a 
deflated right main tire.
