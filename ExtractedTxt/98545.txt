Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, the wheels touched down but then lifted off the runway. The

again, and the airplane veered left, exited the runway, and struck a pole. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 220Â° at 5 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 01.
