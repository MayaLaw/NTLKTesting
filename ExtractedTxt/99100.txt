Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Latrobe, Pennsylvania
Accident Number:
ERA19LA123
Date & Time:
March 12, 2019, 13:36 Local 
Registration:
N945WS
Aircraft:
Beech A100
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation
Analysis 
According to the pilot, while lowering the landing gear handle in preparation for landing, he and the co-
pilot heard a crunching noise. He noticed that the landing gear indicator lights did not turn green, and the 
crew was unable to extend the gear manually. The crew diverted to an airport with emergency 
equipment and a control tower. Following a fly-by, the tower controller reported that the landing gear 
appeared to be extended; however, during the landing roll, the left main landing gear collapsed, followed 
by the right main landing gear, resulting in substantial damage to the airplane. Examination of the 
airplane revealed that the main landing gear mechanical linkage was compromised, and the right main 
landing gear actuator shaft was broken. A mechanic examined the airplane and found that the actuator 
pinion bearing support had separated from the actuator for undetermined reasons, causing a side load to 
the actuator and initiating the fracture.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A landing gear collapse due to the separation of the actuator pinion bearing support from the actuator, 
which resulted in the failure of the actuator shaft.
