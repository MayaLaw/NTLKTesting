Analysis 
Before takeoff for the practice formation flight of four airplanes, the lead pilot briefed all the pilots on 
instructions for the formation changes. The flight began as a finger-four, heavy-left formation with a 
separation between the airplanes of about 80 ft. As the airplanes neared their destination, the lead pilot 
called for the flight to maneuver to "parade," and the airplanes closed the separation between them to 
about 40 ft. The lead pilot then called for the flight to change to an echelon-right formation. The two 
pilots in the trail airplanes left of the lead airplane began their maneuver to the right to position 
themselves behind the airplane that was already in position on the right side of the lead airplane. During 
this maneuver, the pilot in the airplane opposite the right-side airplane lost sight of that airplane due to 
sun glare, and they subsequently collided.Both airplane were able to land at the destination airport.
 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from another airplane in the formation flight due to sun glare.
