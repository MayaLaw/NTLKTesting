Registration:
N2469C
Aircraft:
Cessna 180
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Sys/Comp malf/fail (non-power)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airline transport pilot was conducting a personal flight when the airplane rolled left during the 
landing flare and then landed hard on the left main landing gear (MLG). The airplane bounced and 
landed hard and then bounced again on the left MLG. The left MLG spring separated from the fuselage 
on the third contact with the runway. The airplane subsequently ground looped to the left and came to 
rest heading about 180Â° from the original runway direction. The left main wing spar was substantially 
damaged when the left wingtip impacted the runway.
Postaccident materials examination of the fractured left MLG spring revealed a multiple-origin fatigue 
crack where the landing gear fixation hardware contacted the landing gear spring. The maintenance 
logbooks were not complete; therefore, it could not be determined if the left MLG spring had been 
replaced or overhauled since new. The separation of the left MLG gear spring during landing was likely 
due to the fatigue crack that reduced the overall strength of the landing gear spring.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The separation of the left main landing gear spring during landing due to a preexisting fatigue crack.
