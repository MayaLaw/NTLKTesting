Analysis 
The pilot and the passenger were departing on a local personal flight in the experimental amateur-built 
airplane. The pilot indicated that, during the takeoff climb, about 15 ft above the ground, the airplane 
violently rolled to the right. He applied full aileron and rudder opposite the direction of the roll, but the 
airplane continued to roll to the right, struck the ground with the right wing, and then impacted a tree. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that three of the four hinges connecting the right 
flaperon hanger rib were loose. The wooden material of the flaperon was found dry rotted where the 
hinges connected. The airplane had been flown about 3 hours in the 11 months before the accident. The 
airplane kit manufacturer had issued a service bulletin in 1991 that identified flaperon hanger rib failures 
on the model of the accident airplane. The service bulletin recommended the addition of an aluminum 
reinforcement on each flaperon hanger rib end. The accident airplane did not have the reinforcement 
installed and thus did not have the benefit of additional reinforcement in the attachment point area of the 
hinges.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the flaperon hinge attachment point during takeoff, which resulted in a loss of airplane 
control. Contributing to the accident was the lack of reinforcement of the hinge attachment point in 
accordance with the manufacturer's service bulletin.
