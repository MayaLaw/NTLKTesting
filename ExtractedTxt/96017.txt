Analysis 
The pilot of the aerial application flight indicated that the airplane was in cruise flight on its way to an 
application site when he heard a "pop," and the engine lost total power. The pilot maneuvered the 
airplane for a forced landing on a roadway but changed his forced landing site to a corn field due to 
vehicle traffic. After touchdown, the main landing gear separated, which resulted in substantial damage 
to the fuselage.
Examination of the engine revealed catastrophic internal damage; all compressor turbine blades were 
fractured. Metallurgical examination revealed fracture features consistent with high-velocity impact and 
high-temperature deformation such as "creep." The primary fracture could not be identified; therefore, 
the sequence in which the fractures occurred could not be determined.
The engine was an assembled compilation of manufacturer and aftermarket parts manufacturer approval 
(PMA) parts. Some PMA parts installed were not authorized for the application, and the serial numbers 
reflected in the maintenance records did not match the components installed. For example, the factory 
original compressor turbine disk was installed, but the logbook indicated another disk was installed. The 
compressor turbine disk was a time-limited item, and the total hours on the installed disk could not be 
verified.
