Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while he was climbing the airplane to jump altitude with skydivers onboard, it 
encountered "light rain," so he decided to postpone the jump and return to the airport. Upon crossing the 
runway threshold, about 100 ft above ground level, he initiated a go-around, but the airplane "did not 
climb." The pilot then decided to land on the remaining runway. After touchdown, he applied full 
braking, but the airplane overran the end of the runway into a corn field. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and horizontal stabilizer. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
An automated weather observation station located about 7 miles from the accident airport reported that, 
about 20 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 280Â° at 8 knots. The pilot reported that, at the 
accident airport, about the time of the accident, the wind was from the northwest with rain. The pilot 
landed the airplane on runway 26.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inability to stop the airplane on the wet runway after an aborted go-around, which resulted in 
a runway overrun and impact with terrain.
