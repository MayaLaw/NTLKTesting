Registration:
N23583
Aircraft:
Beech V35B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
While on final during a practice instrument approach, the engine lost total power. An attempted engine 
restart and switching of the fuel tanks was unsuccessful. The flight instructor took control of the 
airplane from the pilot receiving instruction, and executed a forced landing to a corn field. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to both wings. The airplane was recovered from the field and about 1 cup 
of fuel was found in the right fuel tank, and the left wing fuel tank was about 3/4's full. The engine was 
functionally tested for about 10 minutes on the airframe with no anomalies noted. The pilot reported he 
did not check the wing fuel tanks during pre-flight and relied on the cockpit fuel gauges for fuel 
quantity. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to adequately manage the available fuel supply, resulting in fuel starvation and a total 
loss of engine power. Contributing to the accident was the inadequate preflight by the pilot and flight 
instructor, and the flight instructor's failure to monitor the fuel levels.
