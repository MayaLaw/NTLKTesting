Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Positioning
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a cross-country flight over mountainous terrain, he had a tailwind and 
allowed the airplane to get too close to terrain. He initiated a right turn to avoid rising terrain, but the 
terrain was "getting close very quickly." The pilot increased the bank angle, and the nose dropped. The 
pilot then applied forward pressure on the yoke, and full throttle had already been applied. The airplane 
stalled and then impacted terrain. Both wings and the fuselage sustained substantial damage.
In the recommendation section of the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot Aviation Accident 
Report, the pilot reported that his decision to delay the turn away from rising terrain was impulsive and 
the main reason for this accident. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during a turn away from terrain, which 
resulted in an accelerated stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to delay the turn to 
avoid terrain.
