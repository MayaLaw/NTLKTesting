Registration:
N924MM
Aircraft:
Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, shortly after the student pilot conducted the takeoff for the 
instructional flight, they felt the engine vibrate and the airplane shudder. They then noticed that the rpm 
had decreased and that the engine's performance had degraded. The instructor took the controls and 
lowered the nose to prevent a stall. He attempted to land on the intersecting runway, and the airplane 
touched down with about 100 ft of runway remaining. Realizing that the airplane could not be stopped 
within the remaining runway, the instructor steered the airplane right to avoid a steep drop-off past the 
runway end. The airplane subsequently impacted a ditch and then came to rest in grass in a nose-down 
position. The left wing sustained substantial damage.
 
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2 cylinder exhaust valve was stuck open. 
Given this evidence, it is likely that the stuck exhaust valve resulted in the partial loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The stuck No. 2 cylinder exhaust valve, which resulted in a partial loss of engine power and a 
subsequent forced landing and impact with a ditch.
