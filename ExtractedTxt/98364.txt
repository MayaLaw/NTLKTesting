Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Ferry
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he did not realize that he entered the runway at the taxiway intersection about 
halfway down the 5,000-ft-long runway. During the takeoff ground roll, the airplane’s speed was about 
60 knots (below rotation speed) when he realized that the end of the runway was approaching, and he 
needed to either lift off or abort the takeoff. The pilot attempted to continue the takeoff, but the airplane 
would not lift off. The pilot subsequently applied the brakes to try and stop, however there was not 
enough runway remaining and the airplane continued off the end of the runway, over a road, and struck 
a drainage ditch. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that if the pilot had utilized the 
full available runway for the takeoff, or had aborted the takeoff sooner, the runway excursion would not 
have occurred. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s failure to identify that he was not utilizing the full runway for takeoff, and his delayed 
decision to abort the takeoff, which resulted in a runway overrun.
