Analysis 
During a local flight, the pilot, who was also the builder of the airplane, heard a noise accompanied by a 
sudden vibration and partial loss of engine power. He noted that the No. 5 cylinder exhaust gas 
temperature was abnormally low. He recycled the throttle, but the vibration persisted, and the engine lost 
total power. The pilot performed a forced landing into a field, during which the airplane nosed over and 
was substantially damaged.
The pilot had removed cylinder Nos. 3 and 5 from the airplane to install new piston rings several months 
(4 flight hours) before the accident. Postaccident examination revealed internal catastrophic damage to 
the No. 5 cylinder and engine case, consistent with a No. 5 cylinder wrist pin circlip being improperly 
installed. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to properly install a wrist pin circlip, which resulted in internal damage to the No. 5 
cylinder and a subsequent total loss of engine power.
