Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, on a previous flight, the airplane had been filled with fuel and flown for about 
3.8 hours. He added that he attempted to refuel the airplane for the accident flight but that the self-
service fuel station at the departure airport "failed to dispense fuel." He stated that he visually checked 
the tanks and calculated that there would be enough fuel to make the flight. He added that, after 
departing, during cruise flight about 1,800 ft above ground level, the "engine stopped" and that he then 
set the "best glide speed" toward a nearby airport. After realizing the airplane would not reach the 
airport, he executed a 180ยบ turn and landed the airplane on a snow-covered, frozen lake with the landing 
gear retracted. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the subsequent total loss of 
engine power.
