Analysis 
During the initial approach, the pilot and airplane owner were not able to see the airport environment 
due to haze, but both of them were able to see the ground. The pilot continued to use the GPS for 
navigation, and once the airplane was above the airport, they were able to see the runway. The pilot then 
made a 180ยบ turn to align for a final approach; however, the approach was not stabilized, so the pilot 
initiated a go-around. After the climbout, he made another 180ยบ turn for final approach to the opposite 
runway. The airplane touched down on the nose landing gear first and then immediately veered left and 
exited the runway. The pilot attempted another go-around, but the airplane struck a tree and then an 
airport perimeter fence. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. The owner reported 
that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in landing on the landing gear first and a subsequent 
loss of directional control, a runway excursion, and impact with a tree and a fence during an attempted 
go-around.
