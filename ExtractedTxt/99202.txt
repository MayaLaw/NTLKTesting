Analysis 
The pilot and the passenger, who had recently purchased the airplane, were repositioning the 
airplane to the destination airport. According to the passenger, who was a student pilot, the 
pilot was acting as the pilot-in-command and was manipulating the flight controls. The 
passenger stated that the flight was uneventful until landing. During the landing flare, the 
airplane was slightly left of the runway centerline when it suddenly veered left after 
touchdown. As the airplane continued off the left side of the runway, the pilot applied full 
power and attempted to abort the landing. During the aborted landing, the airplane collided 
with the airport perimeter fence then continued into a ditch. The pilot had no memory of the 
accident flight. The postaccident airplane examination did not reveal any mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.  The flaps were found 
fully extended. It is likely that the pilot did not maintain directional control during landing and 
that the airplane did not gain enough altitude during the go-around attempt to avoid the 
airport perimeter fence.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing, which resulted 
in a collision with a fence and impact with terrain during the attempted aborted landing.
