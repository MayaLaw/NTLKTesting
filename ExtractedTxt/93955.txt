Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot stated that, during the landing roll following a normal landing, the airplane began 
pulling to the right. The airplane departed the right side of the runway and traveled down an 
embankment and through a barbed wire fence. When the pilot inspected the airplane, he noted that the 
right main landing gear (MLG) had collapsed. An examination of the landing gear found that the locking 
mechanism had been improperly rigged. Several weeks before the accident, the airplane's right MLG 
was damaged in an incident and had been replaced with a serviceable unit. A review of maintenance 
records noted that a gear retraction test was conducted after the replacement and described as 
satisfactory. It is likely that during this maintenance, the landing gear was improperly rigged, which 
resulted in its collapse on the accident flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Maintenance personnel's failure to properly rig the right main landing gear locking mechanism, which 
resulted in a gear collapse during landing.
