Analysis 
The pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the takeoff roll about 40 knots airspeed 
with full flaps and about 50% of the 900-ft-long runway remaining, the airplane lifted off and began to 
climb. The airplane climbed above the tree line but then descended into ground effect. The pilot 
attempted to clear the trees ahead, but the airplane stalled. The left wing dropped, and the airplane 
descended below the tree line and touched down on the main landing gear, collided with trees, and then 
came to rest inverted. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing lift struts. 
The pilot reported that he could have used the additional runway surface and held the airplane on the 
ground to achieve a more desirable airspeed. Additionally, the Pilotâ€™s Operating Handbook stated not to 
use full flap application during short-field takeoffs.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
