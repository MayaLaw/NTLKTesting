Analysis 
The pilot in the multiengine airplane reported that, following an instrument approach, the airplane broke 
out of the clouds about 600 ft above ground level. The pilot reported that he was concerned that the 
airplane was too high for a safe landing on the wet runway, so he contacted air traffic control and 
requested to circle and land. The tower controller cleared the pilot to circle and land on a 4,000-ft-long 
runway. 
The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, as the airplane approached the last taxiway, the airplane 
slid and overran the runway end. The airplane then rolled down an embankment and impacted a chain 
link fence and trees. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings.
According to Federal Aviation Administration aviation safety inspectors, the airplane touched down 
with about 1,300 ft of runway remaining. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot failure to attain the proper touchdown point on a wet runway, which resulted in insufficient 
runway remaining to safely stop the airplane.
