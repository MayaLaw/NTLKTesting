Analysis 
A pilot-rated witness at the airport reported that, during the airplane’s approach, it appeared to be low 
and fast. The airplane landed hard, bounced about 4 to 5 ft, and then touched back down on the runway. 
The witness added that it appeared that the pilot tried to increase power to recover, but while the 
airplane was about 2 ft off the ground, it turned left. The wings then leveled shortly before the airplane 
aerodynamically stalled and then nosed over into brush.  
The pilot reported that, while "taxiing," he "over sped" the airplane, and the left main landing gear 
impacted a berm. Subsequently, the airplane veered left and bounced, the right wing impacted the 
ground, and the airplane then ground looped and came to rest nose down.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and windscreen.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
An automated weather observation station about 10 miles from the accident site reported that, about 5 
minutes before the accident, the wind was from 250° at 14 knots, gusting to 25 knots. The pilot landed 
the airplane on runway 16.
