Analysis 
The flight crew were preparing to land after a cross-country corporate flight with 12 passengers. The 
pilot reported that the approach was normal but that, during the landing flare, he felt an “unusually hard 
impact.” The landing roll and taxi to the runway were uneventful. Examination of the airplane revealed 
substantial damage to the fuselage, and photographs revealed two tire tracks in the grass about 18 ft 
before the runway threshold and loose dirt and grass around the threshold, consistent with the airplane's 
main landing gear touching down in the grass and subsequently impacting the threshold. The pilot flying 
reported that this was his first landing on that runway at the destination airport. The flight crew did not 
report any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane. It is likely that the flight 
crew failed to maintain the proper glidepath during the approach.
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight crew’s incorrect glidepath and flare to landing, which resulted in a landing area undershoot 
and the main landing gear’s collision with the runway threshold.
