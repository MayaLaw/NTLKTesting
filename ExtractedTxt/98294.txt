Analysis 
The pilot reported that, shortly after transition to cruise flight, he noticed that the engine was "running 
rough," the cylinder head temperature was almost in the red, and the engine rpm and manifold pressure 
were decreasing. He decided to return to the departure airport for a precautionary landing. On approach, 
he decreased the engine power setting and increased the mixture and propeller settings, and the airplane 
then crossed the runway threshold about 80 knots with full flaps. The pilot added that, during the 
landing flare, the airplane "dropped" and then bounced two to three times on the runway. He taxied the 
airplane off the runway, and it was then was towed back to the ramp. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that there no mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was variable at 4 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 33.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing.
