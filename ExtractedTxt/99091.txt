Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during flight, the engine lost partial power. He applied carburetor heat and 
adjusted the mixture, but the engine did not respond. The engine continued to lose power, and the pilot 
conducted a forced landing on rough terrain, during which the right wing struck the ground. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot reported that the temperature about the time of the accident was 30°F and that the dew point 
was 34°F. The atmospheric conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to the accumulation of 
serious carburetor icing at cruise or climb power settings. The pilot stated that the accident could have 
been prevented if he had "checked for carb ice sooner."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power due to the accumulation of carburetor ice, which resulted in a forced 
landing on rough terrain.
