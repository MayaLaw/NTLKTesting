Analysis 
The pilot of the float-equipped airplane reported that, during the initial climb after a water takeoff, about 
200 ft, he turned right, and the engine lost power. He immediately switched fuel tanks and attempted to 
restart the engine to no avail. The airplane descended and struck trees, and the right wing impacted 
terrain.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector that, during the initial climb and 
after the engine lost power, he noticed that the center tank, which was selected for takeoff, was empty. 
He added that passengers stated that the engine did regain power after switching tanks, but the airplane 
had already struck trees.
The pilot reported as a recommendation to more closely follow checklists.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of an empty fuel tank for takeoff, which resulted in fuel starvation and the 
subsequent total loss of engine power.
