Analysis 
According to the pilot in the experimental, exhibition airplane, he departed from a grass airstrip about 1 
hour after a rain shower. After a 15-minute pleasure flight, he landed on the same wet grass airstrip. He 
reported that the airplane touched down about 700 ft past the 2,000-ft-long runway's threshold at 75 
knots with full flaps and the trim set nose up. He applied the brakes multiple times, but the airplane 
overran the departure end of the runway. The airplane's groundspeed was about 13 knots when the right 
wing struck a fence.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right-wing aileron. 
In the recommendation section of the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot Aircraft Accident 
Report, the pilot asserted that the accident could have been prevented if he had taken into consideration 
"the reduced traction offered by the wet grass."
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper planning for landing on a wet grass airstrip, which resulted in a runway overrun.
