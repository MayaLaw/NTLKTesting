Analysis 
The student pilot reported that, during a check ride and a short-field landing in gusting crosswind 
conditions, the touchdown was normal, but the airplane quickly veered right. He added that he and the 
designated pilot examiner applied left rudder to no avail. The airplane exited the runway to the right, the 
right main landing gear struck a taxiway sign, and the airplane came to rest in the grass adjacent to the 
taxiway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right horizontal stabilizer.
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector conducted a postaccident examination. He reported that 
the rudder system appeared normal and functioned properly. He added that there were no pre-existing 
mechanical conditions that could have caused the accident.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about the time of the 
accident, the wind was from 50Â° at 11 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The airplane landed on runway 33. 
Probable Cause and Findings
