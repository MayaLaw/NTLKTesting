Date & Time:

Registration:
N68825
Aircraft:
Stearman A75N1(PT17)
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff for a personal flight, about 1,200 ft mean sea level, the pilot observed spraying oil 
and light oil smoke and detected the smell of oil coupled with an engine vibration. The pilot decided to 
make a forced landing. The engine vibration increased, and the engine seized before landing. The forced 
landing resulted in substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage.
Examination of the radial engine revealed a crankshaft failure due to fatigue; beach marks (also known 
as arrest marks) were observed in the region of the fracture surface. The maintenance records indicated 
that the last engine overhaul was accomplished about 15 years before the accident. Engine time since 
major overhaul recorded at the last annual inspection about 9 months before the accident was 143 hours.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power due to the fatigue failure of the crankshaft.
