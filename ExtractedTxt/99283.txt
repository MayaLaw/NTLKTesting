Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after touchdown, during the landing roll, airplane ground looped and veered 
right. He corrected with left aileron and rudder, but the airplane continued right, exited the runway, and 
rolled over a snowbank. Subsequently, the airplane became momentarily airborne and then touched 
down again. The left main landing gear (MLG) sank into the snow, and the propeller, left MLG, and left 
wingtip impacted terrain. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left-wing rib.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during touchdown, which resulted in runway excursion 
onto snow.
