Location:
Melba, Idaho
Accident Number:
WPR19LA092
Date & Time:
March 1, 2019, 13:45 Local 
Registration:
N6486J
Aircraft:
Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and student pilot were performing maneuvers when the engine lost total power. The 
instructor pitched the nose of the airplane down and asked the student pilot to restart the engine. The 
student pilot was unable to rotate the engine using the starter, and the flight instructor verified that the 
master switch was in the “ON” position. The instructor tried to start the engine himself and was 
unsuccessful. The flight instructor performed a forced landing in a field.
Examination revealed that the idle mixture adjustment screw and spring assembly had separated from 
the carburetor and were found in the lower cowling area. After the airplane was relocated to a nearby 
road the engine rotated via the starter.
Examination of the idle mixture adjustment screw and spring assembly revealed no anomalies. The 
reason that the screw backed out of the carburetor could not be determined. The starter solenoid was 
removed and disassembled. The starter solenoid was examined and revealed a frayed and separated wire 
from the coil to a terminal end. The reasons for this fraying and separation could not be determined. 
Although the starter solenoid was faulty, it is unlikely that the engine would have restarted due to the 
separated idle mixture screw and spring assembly.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power due to a separated carburetor idle mixture adjustment screw and spring 
assembly for reasons that could not be determined.
