Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that he was conducting a personal, cross-country flight and that, when he was 
about 5 miles from his destination airport, he checked the AWOS, which reported wind from 280° at 24 
knots, gusting to 32 knots. He checked the AWOS again while entering the base leg for runway 27, and 
the reported wind had not changed. Upon turning to final, the pilot felt strong wind and added power to 
stay higher than a normal approach. With flaps set to 40°, the pilot decreased power and started to flare 
the airplane. The wheels hit the runway hard, the airplane bounced, and a wind gust pushed the airplane 
left off the runway. After the airplane bounced again, the pilot added power and attempted a go-around. 
Subsequently, the airplane again exited the left side of the runway and struck a cistern and a fence and 
then came to rest inverted. Based on the evidence, it is likely that the pilot improperly flared the airplane 
in strong gusting wind conditions, which resulted in the airplane bouncing and the subsequent loss of 
directional control.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare in strong gusting wind conditions, which resulted in a bounced 
landing, and his loss of directional control during an attempted go-around, which resulted in a runway 
excursion and impact with objects.
