Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing in a gusting crosswind, following the main wheels touching down 
and as the nosewheel was about to touch down, the airplane "abruptly lifted into the air." He 
immediately added full power to go-around, but the airplane drifted to the left off the runway surface 
and impacted an embankment.
The left wing sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observing station at the accident airport, about the time of the accident, recorded 
wind from 270° at 16 knots, gusting to 31 knots. A peak wind of 260° at 31 knots was recorded about 5 
minutes before the accident. The airplane landed on runway 24.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain the runway heading during an attempted go-around in gusting crosswind 
conditions, which resulted in a runway excursion.
