Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot stated that, during the landing roll, he was unable to maintain directional control, and the 
airplane veered right and exited the runway, where the nose landing gear collapsed. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the nose gear steering/centering mechanism was fractured, 
which resulted in the improper alignment of the nose landing gear when it was extended, and a 
subsequent loss of directional control. Three skid marks were visible from the runway centerline to 
where the airplane came to rest. The center skid mark was consistent with the nose landing gear and was 
darker and was about 2-3 times the width of the marks from the main tires; consistent with the nose 
landing gear's misalignment during the landing roll.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the airplaneâ€™s nose wheel steering/centering mechanism, which resulted in a loss of 
directional control and subsequent runway excursion.
Findings

Nose/tail gear strut/axle - Failure
