Analysis 
The pilot reported that, as he was taxiing from the fuel station to his hangar, he taxied north, and then 
turned left onto taxiway delta, at which point his airplane collided with another airplane. He reported 
that he had not seen the other airplane.
The pilot of the other airplane reported that, after landing, he was taxiing to the fuel station on the same 
taxiway. While taxiing, another airplane entered the taxiway and then collided with the left side of his 
airplane.
A video recording from a security camera located on an airport office building showed that the other 
airplane entered taxiway delta without yielding to the airplane that was already taxiing on the taxiway. 
The airplane already taxiing on taxiway delta sustained substantial damage to the left wing and rudder.
Both pilots reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with either airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to yield to traffic established on the taxiway, which resulted in a ground collision.
