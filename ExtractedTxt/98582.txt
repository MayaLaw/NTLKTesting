Analysis 
The pilot-rated owner reported that, after purchasing the airplane and receiving initial training the day 
before and the morning of the accident, he and a pilot-rated friend departed for a cross-country flight to 
their home airport. He added that, after nearly 9 hours of flying, the pilot-rated friend, who was 
manipulating the flight controls, offered to land at the destination airport because he had landed there 
before. The horizon was becoming dark, and they attempted to adjust the panel lights for the instruments 
but realized that the lights were not functioning, so the owner used a flashlight to illuminate the 
instruments for the landing. 
During the landing, the nose landing gear contacted the ground first, and the airplane porpoised. The 
second bounce was more severe, so the pilot initiated a go-around to no avail. The owner added that, 
during the third bounce, the airplane exited the runway to the left and then came to rest nose down. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount and fuselage.
The owner reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport’s automated weather observation system reported that, about the time of the accident, the 
wind was from 270° at 11 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 30.
