Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during the takeoff roll, the experimental tailwheel-equipped airplane's left wing

Subsequently, the airplane nosed over. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the weld that connects the left main landing gear 
and the axle had failed. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and empennage.
