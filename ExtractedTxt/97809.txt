Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, as he approached the destination airport, he noted "a sudden and severe 
noise and vibration" and "aâ€¦stream of gray smoke from under the right side of the [engine] cowling," 
followed by a loss of engine power. The pilot subsequently conducted a forced landing, during which 
the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and right wing.
Postaccident engine examination revealed two holes in the top of the crankcase near the Nos. 3 and 4 
cylinders. A teardown examination of the engine revealed that the No. 4 connecting rod had failed due 
to oil starvation, which resulted in a catastrophic engine failure. Foreign debris, which was similar to a 
paper towel, was recovered from the engine oil sump and the oil pickup screen. Most of the screen area 
was obstructed by the debris, which had interrupted the oil flow from the sump to the engine. 
The airplane maintenance records noted that the alternator and alternator drive gear were replaced about 
8 weeks before the accident. The engine had been operated about 24 hours since the alternator 
replacement. The starter and starter adapter were replaced the day before the accident flight. The engine 
had been operated about 15 minutes since the most recent maintenance work was performed. It is likely 
that maintenance personnel left the paper towel in the engine during the recent maintenance work, which 
resulted in oil starvation, the failure of the connecting rod, and the catastrophic engine failure and 
subsequent total loss of engine power.
