Analysis 
The pilot reported that he landed on his 2,000-foot private grass airstrip with a slight tailwind shortly 
after it had rained. The airplane touched down at the mid-point of the airstrip, which was his normal go 
around point. The pilot further reported that he applied the brakes, but the airplane was not slowing due 
to the wet grass, so he added full power to abort the landing. The airplane became airborne, cleared 
some plastic barrels north of the airstrip, but the right wing collided with other farm equipment. The 
airplane impacted terrain and sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the 
empennage.  
The pilot reported that there were no pre impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to go around after overshooting his intended touchdown point, which resulted in 
impact with farm equipment and terrain during an aborted landing attempt.
