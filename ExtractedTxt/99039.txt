Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot departed on the personal flight after topping off the airplane's fuel tanks. He reported that, 
about 15 minutes after leveling off at 3,500 ft mean sea level, he initiated a climb to 7,500 ft, and the 
engine immediately started to "sputter"; the airplane was about 20 miles off the coast of Florida over the 
Atlantic Ocean. He turned on the fuel boost pump, switched fuel tanks, and applied carburetor heat, to 
no avail. The engine lost total power shortly thereafter. The pilot subsequently ditched the airplane into 
the ocean, egressed, and was rescued. The airplane was not recovered, which precluded a postaccident 
examination. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available evidence, 
which resulted in a ditched landing in the ocean.
