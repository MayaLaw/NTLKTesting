Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during approach, as the airplane crossed over a highway, it 
encountered turbulence and increased lift. He reduced power to correct, and the airplane lost altitude 
quickly. The student added power to compensate, but the airplane landed hard before reaching the 
runway, and the nose landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located about 7 miles south of the airport reported that, about 
10 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 090Â° at 5 knots. The student was landing the airplane 
on runway 9.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper approach path after the airplane encountered turbulence, which resulted in 
the airplane landing hard short of the runway.
