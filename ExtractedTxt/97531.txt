Analysis 
During a cross-country flight, the pilot observed a significant increase in the engine oil 
pressure followed by a sudden drop. He prepared for an emergency landing during which the 
engine speed increased and the engine lost power. The cabin then filled with smoke and oil 
covered the windshield. The pilot was able to activate the airplaneâ€™s parachute and the airplane 
landed about 5 seconds later in a ravine. The airplane was destroyed by a postcrash fire. 
A postaccident examination of the engine revealed evidence of a pre-ignition/detonation event 
that partially eroded the Nos. 2 and 5 pistons. The eroded pistons permitted the pressurization 
of the crankcase, which resulted in oil starvation of the engine. Due to the severe fire damage, 
the cause of the preignition/detonation could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to pre-ignition/detonation for reasons that could not be 
determined based on available information.
