Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, after a three-point landing, the left wing 
"raised up abruptly," so he corrected with left aileron, but the airplane veered left. He then corrected 
with right pedal, but the airplane continued left, exited the runway, and ground looped. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and tail cone. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind was light and variable. An automated weather observation station 
located about 15 nautical miles from the accident site reported that, about 5 minutes after the accident, 
the wind was from 170Â° at 6 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 27. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing with a crosswind, which resulted in a 
runway excursion and subsequent ground-loop.
