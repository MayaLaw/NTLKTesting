Analysis 
The pilot reported that immediately after takeoff, the airplane began to roll to the left. He attempted to 
counteract the roll with right aileron input but could not control the rolling motion; the airplane 
continued to roll to the left. The pilot continued to use right aileron and trim, lowered the nose, and 
executed a forced landing in a field adjacent to the departure airport.
Examination of the wreckage showed that the left aileron actuation arm and attachment bolt were 
missing; there was no associated impact damage. Impact marks were present on the inboard hinge 
consistent with the aileron striking it. No distress or markings were found in the hole for the attachment 
bolt. The bolt or remnants of safety wire were not found.
The pilot reported that he had flown the airplane the day before the accident and noted no problems with 
the flight controls. The most recent annual inspection and maintenance documents did not show any 
work performed on the ailerons. It could not be determined when the bolt came loose from the 
attachment. The absence of the bolt would severely affect aileron flight control as reported by the pilot, 
allowing the aileron to rotate freely around the hinge point with no connection to the flight controls. 
After the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an aviation maintenance alert advising 
owners and operators of SR20 and SR22 airplanes to visually inspect the bolt for the aileron actuation 
arm for the presence of a safety wire.
