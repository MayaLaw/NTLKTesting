Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, after landing, while exiting onto the taxiway, 
he decided to "cut the corner" instead of following the taxiway centerline. He did not see the parked 
glider to his right, and at the last second, he applied brakes. Subsequently, the airplane's tail rose, and the 
elevator struck the glider's vertical and horizontal stabilizer. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right elevator.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
