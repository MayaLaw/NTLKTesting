Analysis 
According to the pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane, he circled the airport to check the wind 
direction and speed and then he initiated a final approach about 70 knots with 3 notches of flaps. He 
reported that the airplane encountered a wind gust before he initiated the landing flare. Upon 
touchdown, the airplane bounced, and he applied forward yoke pressure. The airplane began to drift 
right of the runway centerline during the landing roll, and he applied left rudder and left aileron to 
counter the drift, but when the tailwheel touched down, the airplane veered left. He applied right rudder 
and right brake, but the right main landing gear collapsed, the left wing lifted, and the right wing struck 
the ground. The airplane exited the left side of the runway, and it came to rest in the grass safety area.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to right wing spar. 
The pilot reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was about 7 knots from the west-
southwest. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 32.
The METAR at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was calm and the skies 
were clear. 
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
