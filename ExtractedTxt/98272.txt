Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot lost control of the airplane during takeoff; it subsequently impacted the ground near the 
departure end of the runway and was destroyed. The pilot reported that she had no memory of her 
preflight activity or takeoff. A witness observed the airplane in a nose-high, tail-low attitude during the 
takeoff but lost sight of the airplane behind hangars. He noted that the engine sounded like it was at full 
power. Postaccident examination of the airplane did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Data recovered from an onboard 
engine monitor did not reveal any indication of a loss of engine power during takeoff. The airplane was 
loaded within the gross weight and center-of-gravity limits. Performance data indicated that the 
available runway length was sufficient for takeoff. It is likely that the pilot overrotated during takeoff 
and the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall, which resulted in the airplane departing controlled flight 
and impacting the ground.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during takeoff, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.
