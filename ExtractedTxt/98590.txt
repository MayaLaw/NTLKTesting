Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that he took off from a dry lake bed with a second airplane for people on 
the ground to visually compare the two. After a normal flight, the second airplane landed. The pilot flew 
past the landing spot, pulled into a nose-high attitude, and made a rapid left turn. He pushed on the left 
rudder control, and the left wing stalled. The pilot attempted to recover from the stall; however, the 
airplane was at too low of an altitude to recover, and it impacted the ground in a nose-low attitude. The 
pilot reported no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation. It is likely that the pilot failed to maintain airspeed during the sharp turn, which 
resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed during a sharp turn at low altitude, which resulted in an aerodynamic 
stall.
