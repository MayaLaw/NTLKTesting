Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, while practicing landings, he thought the wind was becoming 
"gusty," so he increased his approach speed. He added that, over the runway threshold, he reduced 
throttle and felt the airplane enter ground effect. The airplane landed hard, bounced, and landed hard a 
second time. The student pilot added full power and turned off carburetor heat, and the airplane landed 
hard a third time. The nose landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest in the grass next to the 
runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 37 minutes before 
the accident, the wind was from 230° at 7 knots. The same automated station reported that, about 24 
minutes after the accident, the wind was from 260° at 7 knots. The airplane landed on runway 24.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard, bounced landing.
