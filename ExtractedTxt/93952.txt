Analysis 
The pilot reported that during the landing flare on a backcountry airstrip he lost forward visual sight due 
to a sun glare. The pilot further reported that as he was about to perform a go around, the wheels touched 
down and the airplane veered off the airstrip to the left. During the runway excursion, the left wheel hit a 
soft spot and the airplane nosed over, which resulted in substantial damage to the right wing strut and 
fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll, which resulted in a runway 
excursion, a nose over, and substantial damage to the right wing strut and fuselage. Contributing to the 
accident was the sun glare which inhibited the pilot's forward visual sight.
