Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot departed on a personal cross-country flight in night visual meteorological conditions. While 
approaching and maneuvering to land at the destination airport, the airplane made a right turn consistent 
with a right base turn to the destination runway. As the airplane began the base-to-final turn, just before 
entering a small cloud, it entered a steep, nosedown spin. Subsequently, the airplane impacted terrain 
and a postimpact fire ensued. 
The airplane damage and ground scars at the accident site were consistent with a near wings-level 
attitude at the time of impact.
Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no preimpact anomalies or malfunctions 
that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that, while maneuvering to avoid the cloud, the 
pilot failed to maintain the proper airspeed, which resulted in the airplane entering an accelerated stall.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot failed to maintain adequate speed while maneuvering at a low attitude during night and entered 
an aerodynamic stall and subsequent spin.
