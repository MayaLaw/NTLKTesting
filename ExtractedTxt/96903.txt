CEN18LA125
Date & Time:

Registration:
N226JK
Aircraft:
Cub Crafters PA18 150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot stated that the takeoff was uneventful until the airplane reached about 50 ft 
above ground level and the engine experienced a total loss of power. The engine regained 
power momentarily, then lost power again. The pilot performed a forced landing during which 
the airplane impacted a ditch. The pilot reported that fuel selector may not have been secured 
in the "both" position detent at the time of the takeoff, and as a result, the engine may have lost 
power due to fuel starvation. A postrecovery examination did not reveal any anomalies that 
would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to verify that the fuel selector was properly set before takeoff, which resulted 
in a total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.
Findings
