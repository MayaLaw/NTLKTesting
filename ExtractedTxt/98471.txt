Loss of engine power (partial)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was attempting to land with quartering tailwind. He stated that he noticed a strong crosswind 
and decided to go around. During the go-around, the pilot added engine power; however, the engine did 
not develop full power. The engine began to sputter and surge as the airplane continued to climb but did 
not regain power, so the pilot performed a forced landing to a field. The airplane nosed over and 
sustained substantial damage.
A postaccident engine test run was performed. The engine started without hesitation, but damage to the 
engine and propeller prevented testing the maximum power setting. Although the engine operation 
during the go-around is similar to that which would be experienced if carburetor ice had 
accumulated during the approach, the weather conditions at the time were just outside those at which ice 
would accumulate. Therefore, the reason for the partial loss of engine could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the 
available information.
Findings
Not determined
(general) - Unknown/Not determined
