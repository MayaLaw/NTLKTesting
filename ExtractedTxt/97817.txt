Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting a local private flight when the airplane had a sudden loss of 
engine power shortly after takeoff. The pilot reported that after an uneventful takeoff, as the 
airplane climbed through 150 ft above ground level, the engine speed rapidly decreased 
from 6,200 rpm to 4,700 rpm. Despite the pilot's corrective actions, the engine continued to 
operate at a decreased power setting and the airplane was unable to maintain altitude. The 
pilot reported that there were trees ahead of the airplane's flight path, so he turned into the 
wind and maneuvered to land on a nearby golf course fairway. The pilot stated that the 
airplane had insufficient altitude and airspeed to flare normally, which resulted in a hard 
landing and substantial damage to both wings and the empennage.
The pilot reported that he did not observe any anomalies during his preflight inspection or 
his before-takeoff engine runup, and that the fuel tank contained about 12 gallons of 
automotive fuel. A postaccident engine examination did not reveal any evidence of 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation during the 
flight. Although the atmospheric conditions were conducive for the formation of carburetor 
icing, the airplane's engine was equipped with carburetors with a variable-venturi design 
that are generally not prone to carburetor icing. Therefore, the reason for the partial loss of 
engine power could not be determined with the available evidence.
