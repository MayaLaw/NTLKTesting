Analysis 
According to the pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane, during approach for landing the airplane 
encountered "slight" turbulence, but the wind was reported as calm. He further reported that there were 
building cumulus clouds in the area. The pilot reported that about 4 feet above the ground, the airplane 
encountered wind gusts from left to right, so he added power and right rudder. He reported that the 
airplane landed on the left main landing gear, immediately veered left, exited the left side of the runway 
and impacted a drainage culvert. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage frame and 
right wing ribs.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with any portion of the 
airplane during the flight that would have prevented normal flight operations.
As a recommendation the pilot reported that he should have gone around at the first indication of 
turbulence and tested the conditions further. He wrote that had the conditions worsened he would have 
departed the area for a suitable airport. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing in gusting wind conditions, which 
resulted in a runway excursion.
