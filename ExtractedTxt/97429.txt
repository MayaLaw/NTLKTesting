Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The student pilot of the experimental, amateur-built airplane reported that he performed an engine run-up at 
3,500 rpm along the entire length of the runway and then turned around for takeoff in the opposite direction. 
After rotation, the engine lost partial power. The airplane descended and struck a tree at the end of the runway 
before coming to rest in grass near the runway end. The fuselage and left wing sustained substantial damage.
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures that would have precluded normal operation. The atmospheric conditions at the time of the accident 
were conducive to the accumulation of serious carburetor icing at glide power and icing at glide and cruise 
power. The engine was not equipped with a carburetor heat system. Therefore, it is likely that the carburetor 
accumulated ice during ground operations, which resulted in the partial loss of engine power during the 
subsequent climb.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power due to carburetor icing.
