Quicksilver MXL II

Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
After the local flight, the noncertificated pilot approached the airport for landing. During the approach, 
he performed a go-around, and the airplane encountered strong winds, so he decided to turn 180Â° to land 
on the opposite runway. While turning, about 1/2 mile from the runway, the engine lost total power, so 
the pilot landed the airplane straight ahead into marshy terrain in a nose-low attitude. The empennage 
and fuselage sustained substantial damage. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The 6-gallon fuel tank was found 
empty, and the fuel cap was found secured to the tank. The pilot reported that the airplane departed with 
5 gallons of fuel onboard for the flight, which was about 1 hour 10 minutes long, and the estimated fuel 
consumption for the airplane was between about 5.3 and 6 gallons per hour. It is likely that, during the 
go-around and maneuver to return to the airport, the fuel supply was exhausted, which resulted in a total 
loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The noncertificated pilot's improper fuel planning and management, which resulted in a total loss of engine 
power due to fuel exhaustion.
