Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane touched down on the main landing gear 
slightly left of centerline. As soon as he lowered the nose landing gear (NLG), he felt the airplane lurch 
left and then right. The pilot attempted to arrest the movement with rudder inputs, followed by 
differential braking, but the airplane continued to veer right uncontrollably. He then intentionally 
increased braking until both wheels started skidding. The airplane skidded sideways and then exited the 
right side of the runway and collided with a taxiway sign before coming to rest upright. 
Examination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures that would have precluded normal operation. Continuity of the NLG steering system was 
confirmed. Given the evidence, it is likely that the pilot did not maintain directional control after 
landing, which resulted in the runway excursion.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing, which resulted in a runway excursion 
and impact with a taxiway sign.
