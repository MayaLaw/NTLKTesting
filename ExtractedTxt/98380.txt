Analysis 
During the airplane's first flight after an annual inspection, the commercial pilot practiced touch-and-go 
landings and then flew the airplane for about 1.5 hours before returning to the airport. While on final 
approach to land, he reduced the engine power. The pilot stated that after the airplane touched down on 
the runway, it was traveling too fast to stop before the end of the runway but not fast enough to abort the 
landing. Subsequently, the airplane continued off the end of the runway, down an embankment, and 
came to rest inverted about 150 ft from the departure end of the runway. Postaccident examination of the 
brakes revealed no anomalies, and the pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or 
failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot stated that he lands farther 
down the runway during full-stop landings because his hangar is at the far end of the runway. Thus, it is 
likely that the pilot landed the airplane too far down the runway and that it was traveling too fast to 
prevent a runway overrun.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to land with insufficient runway remaining to stop, which resulted in a runway 
overrun.
