Accident Number:
ANC19LA006
Date & Time:

Registration:
N2809L
Aircraft:
Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel contamination
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the private pilot, shortly after departing for the local, personal flight and about 300 ft 
above ground level, the engine began losing power and running extremely roughly. He declared an 
emergency and was able to return to the departure airport for landing. During landing, the left wing 
impacted the runway, which resulted in substantial damage to the outboard portion of the left wing.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed large amounts of ice around the fuel caps and on the 
fuel cap vent, and a large amount of debris and water was drained from the carburetor bowl. Due to the 
amount of water found in the carburetor, it is likely that water entered the fuel system through the fuel 
caps and led to the partial loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control during the landing flare, which resulted in the 
wing striking the runway. Contributing to the accident was a partial loss of engine power, 
which resulted from fuel contamination.
