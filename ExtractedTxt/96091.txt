Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the pilot in the experimental, amateur-built, tailwheel-equipped airplane, he touched down 
on a turf surface runway, and the airplane bounced. When the airplane descended to the surface, the 
right main landing gear wheel and brake assembly separated from the landing gear leg. The pilot 
reported that the airplane "skidded down" the runway and nosed over.
The pilot reported that he had recently installed tundra tires on the airplane and that the four bolts that 
came with the tundra tire kit were not long enough to properly secure the wheel and brake assembly to 
the landing gear leg. He recalled that he used four bolts that were longer; however, they were not 
provided by the manufacturer. He asserted that the nuts he used to retain the bolts were provided in the 
wheel assembly kit.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right-wing strut and the left-wing spar.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The separation of the wheel assembly during landing due to the pilot's use of improper retaining nuts 
when he installed the tundra tires.
