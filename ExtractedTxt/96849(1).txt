Analysis 
After leveling off at 9,500 ft, the airline transport pilot switched the fuel selector from the right to the 
left fuel tank of the experimental, amateur-built airplane. He noticed a change in the sound of the engine, 
a decline in fuel flow, and a partial loss of engine power. He switched back to the right fuel tank and 
turned on the auxiliary fuel pump, but this did not correct the problem. Realizing that he would not be 
able to glide to a nearby airport, the pilot made a forced landing in a plowed field. Postaccident 
examination of the engine revealed no discrepancies that would have precluded normal operation. The 
fuel selector was found separated just below the selector handle, and the selector valve was found in the 
90-percent-closed position. The fuel selector assembly showed extensive wear. It is likely that the fuel 
selector separated with the valve in an intermediate position when the pilot changed the fuel selector 
handle position, which resulted in a partial loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the 
nearly closed fuel valve.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the fuel selector valve in a nearly closed position, which resulted in a partial loss 
of engine power due to fuel starvation.
