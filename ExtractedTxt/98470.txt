Analysis 
The pilot was approaching the airport for landing around dusk in visual meteorological conditions at the 
conclusion of a cross-country flight. Radar data depicted the airplane at 589 ft above ground level on a 
downwind leg for the runway at a groundspeed of 108 knots. The airplane then entered a right turn; 
however, rather than aligning with the runway on a final approach leg, the airplane continued the turn 
through 360° and continued on an extended downwind before entering another right turn. The airplane’s 
altitude and groundspeed was fluctuating throughout these maneuvers. Radar contact was lost near the 
accident site about 1 nautical mile from the end of the runway.
The airplane impacted the ground in a vertical, nose-down attitude consistent with an aerodynamic 
stall/spin. Damage signatures indicated that the engine was producing power at the time of the accident, 
and examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. 
Analysis of the radar data revealed that the radius of the airplane's final turn was about 700 ft, which 
would have required a bank angle of about 50° based on the airplane's approximate speed. The data are 
consistent with the pilot's failure to compensate for the increased load factor during the turn and a 
subsequent exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, which resulted in a stall/spin from which 
the pilot was unable to recover given the airplane's low altitude.
