Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane had been sitting on a ramp for 3-4 months before the accident flight. The pilot initially 
could not start the engine due to a discharged battery but then departed on a cross-country flight after a 
ground unit was used to start the airplane. After takeoff, the pilot noticed that the radios became silent. 
He started to troubleshoot the loss of radio communications with no success. He set up to return to the 
airport and land on the runway. The pilot tried to deploy the flaps and landing gear, but there was no 
indication that either extended. He stated that he checked to see if the landing gear extended by using the 
wing-mounted mirrors. The pilot continued the approach. During the landing rollout, the pilot applied 
right rudder and brakes, but the airplane rolled off the runway into the grass. Postaccident examination 
of the airplane revealed a collapsed left main landing gear. No mechanical anomalies were noted with 
the landing gear, and the battery was discharged. It is likely that the discharged battery affected the 
landing gear extension system. However, it could not be determined if the landing gear collapsed during 
the accident sequence or if it was not completely extended before landing. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to take off with a known electrical problem, which resulted in the loss of electrical 
power, problem with the landing gear extension system, and subsequent runway excursion.
