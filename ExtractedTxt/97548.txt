Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after taking off from an unimproved gravel surface in a field, he did not feel 
comfortable with the airplane's performance, so he chose to abort the takeoff. The airplane touched 
down on soft dirt, and the nose landing gear then dug into the dirt and separated from the airplane. The 
airplane then nosed over and came to rest inverted. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and empennage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
