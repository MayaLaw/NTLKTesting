Piper PA28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground

2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor reported that, during takeoff, as the airplane reached rotation speed, the student took 
his feet off the rudder pedals. The airplane drifted left of the runway centerline, and the student then 
quickly placed his feet back on the pedals and pushed the right brake, which caused the airplane to veer 
right. The instructor, who did not have brakes on his side, applied left rudder, but the airplane departed 
the right side of the runway. He added that, during the runway excursion, he heard the tail dragging 
along the ground or striking bushes. Subsequently, the airplane aligned with the runway, but fearing 
damage to the tail, the instructor aborted the takeoff and landed the airplane on the side of the runway, 
and it struck large mounds of dirt and a ditch.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain the runway heading during takeoff and the flight instructor's 
decision to conduct primary flight instruction in an airplane without dual controls.
