Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Mint Hill, North Carolina
Accident Number:
GAA18CA306
Date & Time:
May 27, 2018, 13:30 Local 
Registration:
N582DF
Aircraft:
LITE FLIGHT DRAGONFLY
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while maneuvering about 1,300 ft mean sea level (about 600 ft above the 
ground), he initiated a 180Â° right turn, and about halfway through the turn, the airplane began to descend 
rapidly and would not respond to flight controls. The airplane struck a tree, spun to the right, and came 
to rest on a residential house.
Postaccident examination conducted by the pilot revealed that all controls were intact and operational.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and both wings.
In a written statement provided to the local police department, the pilot reported that he lost control of 
the airplane, and it "spiraled down" and then struck a tree and a house.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Given the pilot's statement, it is likely that the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall/spin when the pilot 
exceeded the airplane's critical angle of attack during a turn.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during a turn, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall/spin.
