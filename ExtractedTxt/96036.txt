Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting a local, personal flight. He reported that, about 1,000 ft above ground 
level and as he began turning the airplane left, it rolled faster than he expected and then "rolled over" 
into an inverted attitude. The pilot regained control of the airplane, and when the airplane was straight 
and level, he saw treetops. He tried to pull up, but the airplane impacted trees and then terrain, which 
resulted in substantial damage to the airframe. 
 
The pilot stated, and a postaccident examination of the airplane confirmed, that there were no 
preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures of the flight controls that would have precluded normal 
operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain roll control while maneuvering, which resulted in a collision with 
trees and terrain.
