Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during landing, the tailwheel-equipped airplane touched down "a 
little" crooked, veered to the right, and he attempted to correct with rudder but the airplane ran off the 
right side of the runway into a field that "wasn't terribly rough." He added that he attempted to takeoff 
from the field, but "realized it wasn't going to happen before the approaching trees." Subsequently, he 
aborted the takeoff, applied the brakes, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left-wing lift strut.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control and his subsequent excessive brake application during 
landing, which resulted in a nose-over.
