Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during an agricultural application flight, he surveyed a field before spraying and 
saw multiple power lines and poles. While spraying the field and after turning, about 20 ft above the 
ground, he pulled up and immediately felt "a massive jerk" and saw a "flash" due to the airplane's nose 
striking a power wire. The airplane entered a descending turn to an open field adjacent to the spray field. 
The pilot pushed the power lever forward but did not get a response. During the forced landing, the right 
wing struck a tree, the airplane rotated 180Â°, and the left wing and empennage impacted the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to see and avoid a power line during an agricultural application flight.
