Analysis 
The pilot was taxiing after landing when he felt a wind gust push the tail to the right and he could not 
correct with full right rudder. He then applied right brake, but the right brake failed. He applied both 
brakes to stop, but the left turn became exaggerated, and he pulled the mixture control to stop the 
engine. The airplane subsequently impacted another airplane parked on the ramp. Postaccident 
examination of the right brake by the operator revealed damage to an O-ring or packing that allowed 
brake fluid to leak past the piston, rendering the right brake inoperative. The brake linings of both brakes 
were replaced about 389 flight hours before the accident. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the right brake while taxiing after landing, which resulted in a loss of directional 
control and collision with a parked airplane.

Brake - Malfunction
