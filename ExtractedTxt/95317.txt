Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane "ballooned up and [he] added a little 
throttle [to] settle the [airplane]." He added that "the [airplane] seemed to settle but felt like it was 
coming down too fast." He applied full power to go around and reduced the flaps to 20Â°. He added that 
"the [airplane] was stalling and so [he] moved the flaps to 0 degrees, which caused the plane to continue 
to stall." Subsequently, the airplane impacted the ground. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and empennage. 
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane's critical 
angle of attack during an attempted go-around, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
