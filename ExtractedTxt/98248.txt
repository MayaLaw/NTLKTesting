Cessna 180
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

Loss of engine power (total)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, on final approach, about 4 miles from the runway, the engine lost all power. He 
diverted to an open field, but during the approach, the airplane struck a power line and then impacted the 
field. The pilot further reported that, although he filled the fuel tanks before the flight, he misunderstood 
how long the airplane could fly with full fuel and thought that he had enough fuel to complete the flight. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight fuel planning and in-flight fuel management, which resulted in fuel 
exhaustion and the total loss of engine power.
