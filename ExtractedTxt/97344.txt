Date & Time:

Registration:
N214FF
Aircraft:
IRLBECK THOMAS H RV 8
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while in cruise flight in the experimental, amateur-built airplane, the 
radio and GPS lights flickered, followed by a total loss of engine power. He attempted to 
troubleshoot the loss of power and then conducted a forced landing to a field, during which the 
airplane impacted a fence; the wings were substantially damaged.
Examination revealed that the wire connection from the main battery to the engine's electronic 
ignition had melted just above the terminal attachment. Although the airplane was equipped 
with a backup battery, the connection from the backup battery to the ignition was 
disconnected, which pre and the wire connection from the electronic ignition to the backup 
battery was not connected to the battery terminal. While the melted wire that connected the 
main battery to the electronic ignition would still have allowed power to the electronic ignition 
from the backup battery, the lack of connection to the backup battery provided no power to the 
electronic ignition and resulted in the total loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to damaged and disconnected electronic ignition wires from both the 
main and backup batteries, which resulted in a forced landing.
