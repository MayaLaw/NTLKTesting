Analysis 
The student pilot and instructor departed on a local instructional flight, completing about 35 
minutes of airwork before returning to the airport to practice takeoffs and landings. They 
performed several landings and used full carburetor heat during each approach. During the 
initial climb for the last takeoff, the engine response was "normal" until about 300 ft above 
ground level, when the engine "abruptly" lost total power. The flight instructor took the flight 
controls, attempted to restore engine power, and turned the airplane toward a clearing, where 
it impacted trees before impacting the ground. 
Fuel samples from the wings, gascolator, and carburetor revealed solid debris similar to dirt 
and orange sealant in all samples. Additionally, an air filter element was found lodged in the 
carburetor venturi. Because the airplane had flown for a few hours since maintenance was 
completed and the engine stopped producing power "abruptly," it is likely that the engine was 
starved of fuel as a result of the debris that migrated through the fuel system, which resulted in 
the total loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power as a result of debris contamination of the fuel, which resulted in 
fuel starvation.
