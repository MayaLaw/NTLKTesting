Registration:
N81383
Aircraft:
Grumman AA5
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was conducting a personal cross-country flight when he became lost. The pilot reported that he 
did not understand how to navigate using the GPS that was installed in the airplane before the flight. 
Instead of continuing to the southeast toward the intended destination, the pilot turned south for the 
remainder of the flight. After flying for about 1.5 hours, the pilot became concerned about how much 
fuel remained and decided to land to refuel. The pilot stated that the airplane had a total loss of engine 
power while in the airport traffic pattern, and that he did not maintain adequate airspeed, which resulted 
in an aerodynamic stall during the turn from the base leg to final. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the fuselage and empennage during impact.
Examination of the airplane revealed no fuel in the left fuel tank, about 7 gallons of fuel in the right fuel 
tank, and less than 2 fluid ounces of combined fuel from the electric boost pump, the fuel line to the 
carburetor, and the carburetor fuel bowl. The pilot reported that the fuel selector valve was positioned to 
the left fuel tank when the loss of engine power occurred. The loss of engine power was likely due to 
fuel starvation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot’s improper inflight fuel management, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel 
starvation and the pilot’s failure to maintain adequate airspeed, which resulted in the airplane exceeding 
its critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude.
