Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, while landing in a crosswind during thunderstorm activity, she 
feared that a go-around would put her into the storm. She added that the airplane bounced during the 
initial touchdown. She then applied "a bit of power" to recover, but the airplane porpoised, and the nose 
landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount.
The director of flight operations for the flight school reported that the student was endorsed for the solo 
cross-country, that she had received a weather briefing, and that she and her instructor had a briefing and 
discussion about the airfield and weather before her departure. He added that she was supposed to arrive 
before the summer storms started, but the storms came early.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, 
the wind was from 140Â° at 15 knots. The student landed the airplane on runway 10R. The observation 
further indicated thunderstorm activity and cumulonimbus clouds with occasional lightening in clouds 
and clouds to ground.
