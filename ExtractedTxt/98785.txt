Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane broke up in-flight and the wreckage was located about 6 miles southwest from the airport, 
scattered over a large swamp area; there were no witnesses to the accident. Examination of the airplane 
revealed that the wing forward spar had two significant failure areas on both the left and right wings; 
one was located at the side of the fuselage and one was located at the outboard wing attach points. This 
was indicative of shear failure of the rear spar upper attach bolts and tensile overload at the rear spar 
upper spar cap. The primary wing failures were due to negative overload causing failure of the upper 
attach points on the left and right wings.
High positive loads on the horizontal stabilizers would generate downward bending loads in the fuselage 
that would be greatest at the rear spar location. Given these findings, it is likely that the pilot performed 
a pull-up maneuver aggressively or at high speed, possibly while performing aerobatics. The pull up 
would have generated significant down force on the tail, resulting in the left and right fuselage longerons 
failing in tensile overload due to the downward bending loads in the fuselage in excess of the structural 
capabilities of the airplane. This sudden failure would cause the airplane to pitch over violently resulting 
in the negative overload wing failure.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The in-flight failure of the fuselage, as a result of the pilot conducting maneuvers that exceeded 
the structural capabilities of the airplane.
