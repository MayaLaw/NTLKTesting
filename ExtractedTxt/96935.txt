Registration:
N372WP
Aircraft:
Cessna 310R
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airline transport pilot reported that the landing gear position lights were all green during the 
approach and that the landing was normal. During the landing rollout, the right landing gear collapsed. 
A witness stated that the landing appeared normal and was not a hard landing. The airplane skidded for 
about 1,200 to 1,500 ft and veered off the side of the runway, which resulted in substantial damage to 
the horizontal stabilizer and elevator. 
Examination of the airplane's landing gear parts that were broken revealed that the fracture features of 
the end fitting assembly mating adjustment screw, the bellcrank assembly bolt, and the flange were 
consistent with overstress. Examination of the fracture surfaces of the end fitting bolt revealed that it had 
separated through a thread root on the end of the bolt; however, the cause of the end fitting bolt 
separation could not be determined due to smearing and secondary damage of the fracture surface. 
Because the witness reported that the landing was not a hard landing, it is unlikely that the failure 
occurred during the accident landing sequence. It is likely that the separation of the end fitting bolt led to 
the landing gear collapse.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The landing gear collapse due to the separation of the end fitting bolt for reasons that could not be 
determined based on the available evidence.
