Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while on final approach for landing, the airplane impacted powerlines 
and collided with the ground, resulting in substantial damage. He stated that he knew of the 
powerlines, but stated that he had not checked the airport/facility directory, which noted the 
placement and height of the powerlines.
Examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have 
precluded normal operation. A review of airport information revealed that the powerlines were 
located 50 ft from the runway threshold and were 60 ft tall. The accident is consistent with the 
pilotâ€™s failure to maintain clearance from a known obstacle during the landing approach.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from powerlines during the visual approach.
