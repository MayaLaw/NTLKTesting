Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during cruise flight, he descended the airplane due to strong winds and 
determined that the airplane had about 10.9 gallons of fuel remaining, which he equated to about 1 hour 
of flight. He added that, about 6 miles from the destination airport, the airplane "ran out of gas" and that 
the engine lost power. He performed a forced landing on a field, and, during the landing flare, the left 
main landing gear impacted a berm near the edge of the field. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper in-flight fuel planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a subsequent total loss 
of engine power.
