Analysis 
The agricultural application pilot reported that, during the initial climb and as soon as the airplane 
"broke ground," he turned left and subsequently encountered turbulence that caused the left wing to 
"dip." He added that he applied full right aileron and rudder but that the airplane continued to sink and 
turn left. Subsequently, the left wing impacted terrain, the airplane cartwheeled, and a postcrash fire 
ensued. 
The fuselage, empennage, and both wings sustained substantial damage. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
An automated weather observation station, 12 nautical miles south of the accident site, reported, about 
the time of the accident, calm wind, clear skies, temperature 84째F (29째C), and dew point 64째F (18째C).
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain lateral/bank control during the initial climb in turbulent conditions.
