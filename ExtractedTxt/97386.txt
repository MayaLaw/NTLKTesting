Analysis 
The pilot reported that, after overflying the airport to determine the wind direction, she landed in 
variable crosswind conditions. During touchdown "at or near stall speed," the tailwheel-equipped 
airplane encountered a wind gust. She added that the airplane veered left and that she attempted to 
correct with immediate application of right rudder and right brake. Subsequently, the airplane exited the 
left side of the runway into the grass, and the right wingtip struck the ground. She added that she was 
able to taxi the airplane to park.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing, right wing spar, and right wing lift strut.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system located at the accident airport reported that, about the time 
of the accident, the wind was from 140Â° at 11 knots, gusting to 18 knots. The pilot landed on runway 34.
Probable Cause and Findings
