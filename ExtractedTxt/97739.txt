Analysis 
The pilot receiving instruction reported that, during an airplane checkout, he performed a simulated 
engine failure. He added that, during the landing flare, the airplane "ran out of energy," and the right 
wing struck the runway.
The flight instructor reported that, about 5 ft above the runway, the airplane aerodynamically stalled, and 
the right wing dropped and struck the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of 
attack during the landing flare, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
