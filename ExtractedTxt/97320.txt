Analysis 
The pilot reported that, immediately after landing, the tailwheel-equipped airplane veered left and then 
right. Subsequently, he applied "heavy" brakes, and the airplane exited the right side of the runway and 
then nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right-wing lift strut.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system located at the accident airport reported that, about the time 
of the accident, the wind was from 280Â° at 10 knots, gusting to 19 knots. The pilot landed the airplane 
on runway 3.
