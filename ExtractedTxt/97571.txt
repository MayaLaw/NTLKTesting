Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During the second wheel landing of the flight and shortly after the tailwheel touched down on the 
runway, the airplane drifted right. The commercial pilot attempted to stop the drift by applying the 
wheel brakes. Subsequently, the airplane nosed over. The right wing, rudder, and vertical stabilizer 
sustained substantial damage. During a postaccident interview, the pilot stated that he "got on [the] 
brakes a little harder than I should have." 
Examination of the landing gear assembly and rudder control linkages did not reveal any evidence of 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Therefore, 
it is likely the pilot's overapplication of the brakes resulted in the nose-over.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's overapplication of the wheel brakes during landing, which resulted in a nose-over.
