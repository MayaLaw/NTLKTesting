Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane was in cruise flight when the engine's forward main seal (crankshaft seal) began to leak 
engine oil. Shortly thereafter, the engine lost power, and the pilot subsequently performed a forced 
landing to a field about 5 miles west of the departure airport. 
Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the bottom half of the crankshaft seal had slipped 
forward from its placement, which allowed engine oil to leak from the engine. The seal had an 
approximate time in service of 21 hours since its replacement. It is likely that maintenance personne 
installed an improperly sized crankshaft seal, which led to it slipping, allowing the engine oil to leak.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the engine's front bearing seal due to maintenance personnel's installation of an 
improperly sized crankshaft seal, which resulted in oil starvation and a forced landing.
