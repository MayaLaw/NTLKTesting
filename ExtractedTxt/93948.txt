Registration:
N18601

Cessna 150L

Defining Event:

Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot had completed a local flight and was landing at his unlighted grass airstrip toward the west 
shortly after sunset. While landing, the airplane impacted a riverbank short of the runway, about 6 ft 
below the elevation of the runway, which caused the airplane to nose over and come to rest inverted. 
The pilot was seriously injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and left 
wing. The pilot did not recall the accident but reported that there were no malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have contributed to the accident. It is likely that the pilot did not obtain a proper aimpoint 
during the approach due to reduced visibility from the setting sun, which resulted in a landing short of 
the runway. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to obtain a proper aimpoint during landing due to reduced visibility from the setting 
sun.
