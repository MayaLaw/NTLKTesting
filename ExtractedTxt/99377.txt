Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a biennial flight review, the flight instructor told him to expect a 
simulated engine failure during takeoff and an engine-out approach to a perpendicular runway. After 
departure and about 400 ft above ground level (agl), the instructor reduced power, and the pilot turned 
left to land on the perpendicular runway. He overshot the runway, banked to 40Â°, and felt a "strong 
sink." He leveled the wings and added full power about 150 to 200 ft agl, but the airplane continued to 
descend. The instructor stated he considered taking the flight controls, but the pilot maintained control. 
The airplane landed hard, the right main landing gear (MLG) struck a hole, the airplane veered right, and 
the left MLG separated.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's steep bank turn at low altitude, which resulted in a rapid descent and hard landing.
