Analysis 
The pilot reported that he decided to perform a high-speed taxi after repairs had been made to the 
tailwheel-equipped airplane "to verify controls and instrumentation," but the airplane became airborne, 
and he decided that the safest action was to fly one pattern and land. He reported that, during the landing 
roll, the ground speed decreased to about 3 knots, the brakes locked up, and the airplane then nosed 
over. The pilot added that the airplane was equipped with heel brakes and that it had been 13 years since 
he had flown a tailwheel-equipped airplane with heel brakes. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and the rudder.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper brake application during the landing roll, which resulted in a nose-over. 
Contributing to the accident was the pilot's lack of recent experience using heel brakes.
