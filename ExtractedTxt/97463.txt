Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a touch-and-go, he came in too fast, and the airplane landed hard and 
bounced. He added that he should have gone around but chose to "ride it out." Subsequently, the 
airplane porpoised, the nosewheel collapsed, and the airplane came to rest nose down on the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the accident airport reported that, about 5 minutes before 
the accident, the wind was from 180° at 8 knots and that, about 15 minutes after the accident, the wind 
was 170° at 8 knots, gusting to 15 knots. The pilot landed on runway 16.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing and subsequent porpoise.
