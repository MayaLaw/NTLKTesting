Registration:
N207PC
Aircraft:
RAYTHEON AIRCRAFT COMPANY 
A36
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was at cruise altitude en route on a cross-country flight from Arizona to Washington when he 
noted that the engine oil pressure indicated zero and the manifold pressure was near zero. He then heard 
“…a loud bang, as though the engine had thrown a rod.” The cabin filled with smoke and oil covered the 
windscreen, and the pilot conducted a forced landing into a stand of trees, during which the airplane 
sustained substantial damage. 
Examination of the airframe revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. An 
examination of the engine revealed three holes in the crankcase, each consistent with an internal engine 
failure. All six cylinders remained attached to their respective cylinder bays; there was no indication of 
impact damage. The Nos. 2, 4 and 5 connecting rods had separated from the crankshaft. All rod bearings 
displayed lubrication distress consistent with oil starvation. The oil line B-nut attached to the 
turbocharger scavenge check valve was loose. 
Based on the available information, it is likely that the loose oil line B-nut resulted in a gradual loss of 
oil during the long cross-country flight, which subsequently resulted in the separation of the connecting 
rods due to oil starvation and a total loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to oil starvation as a result of a loose oil line B-nut.
