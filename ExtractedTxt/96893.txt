Analysis 
The pilot of the tundra-tire- and tailwheel-equipped airplane was making a night landing at a high-
altitude airport. He reported that, to mitigate the crosswind component, he decided to land from right to 
left on the 100-ft-wide runway. He added that the wheel landing was normal, but the airplane would not 
return to centerline from the left side of the runway. He added power to go around, but the left main 
wheel sheared off, and the airplane ground looped to the right.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and empennage.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about the time of the 
accident, the wind was from 220Â° at 19 knots, gusting 31 knots. The airplane landed on runway 27.
The airplane's operating handbook stated that the maximum demonstrated crosswind component was 13 
mph/11 knots. The calculated crosswind component using steady winds was 15 knots, using gusting 
winds, it was 24 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in a gusting crosswind 
conditions, which exceeded the airplane's maximum demonstrated crosswind and resulted in the collapse 
of the left main landing gear.
