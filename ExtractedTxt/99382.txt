Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he was performing stop-and-go takeoffs and 
landings. During a takeoff roll, the tailwheel lifted off the ground, and the airplane encountered a 
significant wind from the left. He applied left aileron and right rudder to compensate for the wind, but 
the airplane ground looped to the left.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and right aileron.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot added that a "slower application of the throttle and keeping the tailwheel on the ground longer 
during the takeoff roll, will prevent this type of accident from occurring in the future."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper throttle application and subsequent failure to maintain directional control during the 
takeoff roll in gusting left crosswind conditions, which resulted in a ground loop.
