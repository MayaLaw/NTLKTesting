Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Broomfield, Colorado
Accident Number:
CEN18LA162
Date & Time:
May 7, 2018, 11:39 Local 
Registration:
N3292Y
Aircraft:
Cessna 182
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Sys/Comp malf/fail (non-power)
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot had conducted a personal flight to a grass airstrip, where he completed two 
uneventful full-stop landings before returning to the departure airport for a final landing. 
The pilot reported that on the final landing the airplane initially touched down on the main 
landing gear, but when the nose gear contacted the runway, the airplane immediately 
swerved right and nosed over in the grass beside the runway, resulting in substantial 
damage to the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and right wing strut. A witness reported seeing the 
airplane on final approach with its nose wheel rotated about 75° from its normal alignment. 
The upper link arm of the nose landing gear torque link assembly had fractured near its 
upper end, which allowed the nose wheel to rotate freely on the landing gear strut. A 
laboratory examination revealed evidence of a downward bending overstress failure. 
Although the examination also identified an isolated area of preexisting fatigue on the right 
flange and a closed crack on the left flange, they did not contribute to the bending 
overstress failure of the upper torque link. Based on the available evidence, the upper link 
arm fractured earlier in the flight, and the pilot would have been unaware of the damage to 
the nose gear before the final landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The overstress fracture of the upper link of the nose landing gear torque link assembly, 
which resulted in the pilot’s inability to maintain directional control during landing.
