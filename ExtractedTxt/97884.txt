Analysis 
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during a left-wing-low (sideslip) landing and 
before touchdown, he leveled the wings, and the airplane bounced. He then increased the throttle slightly 
and adjusted the pitch to cushion the subsequent bounce, but the airplane veered right, exited the runway 
to the right, and ground looped. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport's automated weather observation station reported that, 5 minutes after the accident, the wind 
was from 310Â° at 6 knots, gusting to 12 knots. The pilot landed the airplane on runway 34.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing and his subsequent failure to 
maintain directional control in a gusting, left quartering headwind.
