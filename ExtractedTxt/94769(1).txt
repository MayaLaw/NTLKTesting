Analysis 
The instrument-rated private pilot had filed an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan for the 
cross-country flight, but intended to depart under visual flight rules conditions and open his IFR 
flight plan shortly after takeoff. He stated that, during the preflight inspection, he did not see 
any low clouds and was able to see stars above him. The airplane departed shortly before 
sunrise, and the pilot stated that, while retracting the flaps after takeoff, he encountered low-
level fog about 300 ft agl and the airplane entered instrument meteorological conditions. The 
pilot made a right turn to avoid the final approach course to the opposite runway, then saw a 
tree and attempted to avoid impacting it; he then recalled waking up in the airplane on the 
ground. Weather conditions near the accident site about the time of the accident included 
scattered clouds at 500 ft and a visibility of 6 miles in mist. The series of events described by 
the pilot was consistent with a loss of control due to spatial disorientation, likely due to the 
unexpected loss of visibility during the initial climb.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions (fog) during initial 
climb, which resulted in a loss of control due to spatial disorientation.
