Analysis 
The student pilot and flight instructor in the Cessna were landing at the non-tower-controlled airport 
when a North American T-28 collided with the Cessna from behind, fatally injuring the student. Radar 
data indicated that the T-28 overflew the airport before joining the downwind leg of the traffic pattern 
for the landing runway; about this time, the Cessna was on final approach. The pilot of the T-28 reported 
that the bright sun and the haze created a glare on the windscreen that obscured his forward vision, 
making it difficult for him to see directly ahead, and the glare became worse as he descended toward the 
runway on final approach. The T-28 pilot saw the Cessna ahead of him on the runway just before the 
collision occurred.
The instructor onboard the Cessna could not recall the details of the flight but reported that his student 
would have made radio calls on the airport's common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) as they 
approached the airport for landing. The CTAF was not recorded, and the radio frequency settings of the 
Cessna could not be determined due to thermal damage. Examination of the T-28 revealed that its radio 
was not tuned to the airport's CTAF; therefore, the T-28 pilot was neither receiving position reports from 
other aircraft in the traffic pattern, nor was he broadcasting his position. The circumstances of the 
accident are consistent with the T-28 pilot's failure to see and avoid the Cessna while landing with 
reduced visibility due to sun glare, and it is likely that his failure to monitor and use the CTAF 
contributed to the accident.
