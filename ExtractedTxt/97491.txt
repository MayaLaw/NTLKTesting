Analysis 
The pilot stated that he conducted a preflight inspection, during which he sampled the fuel and 
recovered about 4 ounces of water. He then performed an engine run-up and taxied to the 
runway for departure. During the climbout, when the airplane was about 100 ft above ground 
level, the engine lost total power. The pilot performed a forced landing, and the airplane 
collided with trees. The fuselage, wings, and empennage were substantially damaged during 
the impact. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed a large bird nest in the engine 
cowling and cabin air intakes. The condition of the engine air intake could not be determined 
due to impact damage. The propeller was able to rotate and valvetrain continuity and the 
operation of the magnetos was confirmed. Given the available evidence, the reason for the loss 
of engine power could not be determined.
