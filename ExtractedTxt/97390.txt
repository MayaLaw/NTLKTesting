Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while landing off airport on an upsloping ridge, the tailwheel-equipped airplane 
"touched down harder than preferred." He applied full throttle, initiated a go-around, and attempted to 
turn toward the down-sloping side of the hill. The airplane briefly became airborne, but it then 
aerodynamically stalled and nosed down into the tundra. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mount. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing on upsloping terrain, and his 
subsequent failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of 
attack during an attempted go-around, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
