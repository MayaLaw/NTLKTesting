Flight Conducted Under:

Analysis 
The pilot reported that, before the flight, he performed weight and balance and performance calculations 
with the initial fuel level in the airplane. The fuel tanks were then filled full of fuel, but he did not 
amend the weight and balance or performance calculations.
The pilot reported that, during takeoff, after the airplane became airborne, he did not feel comfortable 
with the way the airplane was performing, so he reduced power and landed the airplane on the remaining 
runway. He added that he did not have enough runway to stop and attempted to exit on a taxiway but 
"understeered," and the airplane exited the runway into a ditch.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The airplane's maximum gross weight was 2,460 lbs, and the weight at the time of the accident was 
2,600 lbs, which was about 140 lbs over the maximum gross weight and likely affected the airplane's 
takeoff performance.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to take off with the airplane over its maximum gross weight due to his failure to 
perform preflight weight and balance calculations, which affected the airplane's takeoff performance,
