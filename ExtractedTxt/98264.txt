Analysis 
The pilot reported that all preflight inspections and control checks were normal; however, after liftoff, 
the left wing dipped, and the airplane pulled hard to the left. The pilot input corrective control actions, 
but the airplane continued to veer left. Realizing that the airplane would not be able to climb over 
approaching trees, the pilot reduced engine power and aimed the airplane between two trees in order to 
cushion the impact. The airplane came to rest upright about 450 ft east of the runway. 
Examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation of the flight control system, although full aileron travel could not be confirmed due to impact 
damage. The cockpit/cabin floor was plywood and contained multiple cutouts for the control system, all 
of which were properly sized to permit full travel of the respective controls; however, none of the 
control openings were equipped with flexible boots or were otherwise shielded to prevent foreign 
objects from either falling under the floor or becoming caught between the control and the cutout 
perimeter and thereby restricting or preventing control travel. A screwdriver and a bungee cord were 
found on the cockpit floor after the accident, but whether they contributed to the accident could not be 
determined. The shape and location of the rear seat rudder pedals, in combination with the anchor attach 
point locations of the front seat lap belts, was such that when fastened, either of the front seat lap belt 
halves could inadvertently capture or trap a rudder pedal and thereby restrict its travel.
The reason for the pilotâ€™s inability to maintain directional control during the takeoff and initial climb 
could not be determined based on the available information.
