Registration:
N46SW
Aircraft:
RIchard Silva Seawind
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he attempted to take off from a lake with a 20- to 30-knot crosswind. A video of 
the takeoff showed that, as the right wing lifted, the left wingtip contacted the water. Subsequently, the 
seaplane bounced and impacted the water hard with the nose oriented to the left. The pilot was able to 
correct the course heading and continued to water taxi without further incident. The pilot added that he 
should not have departed in high crosswind conditions and admitted to pilot error. The seaplane 
sustained substantial damage to the right aileron. The Federal Aviation Administration inspector who 
conducted a postaccident examination of the seaplane reported that he established flight control 
continuity and that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the seaplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to attempt to take off from a lake in high crosswind conditions, which 
resulted in the right wing lifting, the left wing impacting the water, and the airplane bouncing and then 
impacting the water hard.
