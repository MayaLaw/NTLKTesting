Analysis 
The solo student pilot reported that, while performing a touch-and-go landing, upon touchdown, the 
airplane landed hard and bounced. He added full power to go around, determined that the airplane was 
flying normally, and continued in the traffic pattern. He landed the airplane a second time, and it 
bounced a little, and he then taxied the airplane to the ramp without further incident.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
