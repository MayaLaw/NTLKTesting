Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during a soft-field takeoff from a private grass airstrip, he applied slight aft 
pressure to the yoke to lighten the load on the nosewheel. The airplane became airborne, but while in 
ground effect, the left wing dropped about 10ยบ, and the left main landing gear contacted the runway. The 
airplane settled back on the ground pointing about 30ยบ left of the runway heading. The airplane then 
departed the runway to the left and ground looped, during which the left landing gear collapsed. The 
airplane slid backward and came to rest upright on the field adjacent the airstrip. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both ailerons. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot added that the airplane's weight and balance were within the operational limitations in the 
Pilot's Operating Handbook. 
The automated weather observation system located on an airport 18 nautical miles (nm) south of the 
accident site reported that, about 17 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 90ยบ at 5 knots. An 
automated weather observation station located on an airport 22 nm southeast of the accident site 
reported that, about 14 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 110ยบ at 3 knots. The airplane 
departed from runway 26.
