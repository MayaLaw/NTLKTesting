Analysis 
The pilot reported that, during landing, while over the runway, he believed the "right wing lifted a bit," 
and the airplane drifted left. The airplane touched down, veered left, and he applied right rudder. 
Subsequently, the airplane exited the left side of the runway and impacted trees.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the accident airport reported that, about the time of the 
accident, the wind was variable at 5 knots. The pilot landed on runway 8.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain lateral control of the airplane during landing, which resulted in a loss of 
directional control and subsequent runway excursion.
