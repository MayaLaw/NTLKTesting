Analysis 
On May 1, 2018, at about 2:53 pm EDT, an Endeavor 3413, CRJ900, N606LR, was struck by Delta 212, 
B767-300ER, N172DN, while awaiting to be marshalled into the gate at John F. Kennedy International 
Airport (KJFK), Queens, New York.  Both flights were operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 121 as regularly scheduled passenger flights.  Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the 
time of the accident.
According to flight crew statements, both airplanes conducted normal landings and were cleared to taxi 
to their respective gates.  Delta 212 was taxing to gate B30 and following behind Endeavor 3413 as 
it  turned into gate B30.  The captain of Endeavor 3413 stated that he had stopped short of the gate to 
await the ground crew.  The captain of Delta 212 indicated that as they approached the airplane, he 
noticed that the wing walkers had stopped the Endeavor airplane prior to its gate, and so he stopped 
prior to entering the ramp area.  When the Endeavor airplane started to move forward into the gate, he 
began to slowly taxi behind it, however, the captain indicated that he lost sight of airplane out the right 
window.  He indicated that he turned slight to the left (away from Endeavor 3413) after his first officer 
advised him to provide additional clearance to ensure adequate separation.  After he thought they would 
be safety clear of the airplane, he then turned back onto the taxiway centerline. As the airplane 
continued taxiing to the gate, the Delta flight crew heard over ramp control that they had struck 
Endeavor 3413. After parking, both airplanes were inspected and it was found that Delta 212's right 
winglet sustained minor damage and Endeavor 3413 sustained substantial damage to its horizontal and 
vertical stabilizer. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure of the captain of Delta 212 to ensure adequate clearance while taxiing behind Endeavor 3413.
