Registration:
N45MJ
Aircraft:
Piper PA31
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Flight test
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while his airplane was undergoing an annual inspection, maintenance 
personnel suggested that an inner landing gear door kit be installed. After the door kit 
installation was completed, numerous test flights were conducted. Rigging adjustments were 
made after each flight, and while taxiing back to the ramp following the last flight, the right 
landing gear collapsed. A postaccident extension and retraction test were performed using a 
hydraulic test unit. Both normal and emergency (hand pump) landing gear extension and 
retraction tests were performed. When checking the actuator rigging, both left and right main 
landing gear actuators did not drive the main gear into a locked position. No preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures of the landing gear system were observed, thus it is likely 
that the rigging condition resulted in the collapse of the right main landing gear.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Maintenance personnelâ€™s improper rigging of the main landing gear actuators, which resulted 
in the collapse of the right main landing gear.
