Aviation Investigation Final Report
Location:
Grand Forks, North Dakota
Accident Number:
WPR18LA234
Date & Time:
August 21, 2018, 08:50 Local 
Registration:
N7300M
Aircraft:
Air Tractor AT 400
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot was maneuvering the airplane during an aerial application over a field. A witness noticed that 
the airplaneâ€™s final turn was different than previous turns. Just before the airplane impacted the ground, 
the witness noticed a puff of smoke or liquid coming from the airplane.  As the witness was a distance 
away, she was not certain. During the impact, the airplane sustained substantial damage. 
Examination of the engine revealed circumferential rubbing marks due to contact between the 
compressor turbine disk assembly and power turbine (PT) disk assembly. Of the 41 PT blades, 18 were 
recovered, and those blades exhibited fracture surfaces consistent with overstress fracture under elevated 
temperatures. Impact marks were identified inside the exhaust duct. The fracture of these blades likely 
occurred at ground impact when the engine was operational.
It is likely that one or more of the unrecovered PT blades failed for an undetermined reason during the 
flight and impacted adjacent PT blades and components, including the exhaust duct. The internal engine 
damage from the released blades caused the PT disc assembly to fail, resulting in a loss of engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power while maneuvering due to the failure of the power turbine blade assembly for 
reasons that could not be determined based on available evidence.
