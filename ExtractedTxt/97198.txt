Analysis 
The pilot and passenger were conducting a cross-country flight in the pilot's newly-purchased 
and refurbished World War II-era airplane when the engine experienced vibrations, smoke, an 
oil leak, and a partial loss of power. The airplane was over remote, rugged, tree-covered terrain 
with no emergency landing areas, and the occupants, who were wearing emergency parachutes, 
egressed about 1,500 ft above ground level. Both the pilot and passenger sustained serious 
injuries during their landings under parachute. Radar data indicated that the airplane 
continued a steady descent into terrain. The wreckage was never located despite numerous 
searches; therefore, the engine could not be examined and the reason for the loss of engine 
power or smoke and vibrations could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available 
information.
